<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The thirty-four stories included within this volume
do not illustrate the bloody, revengeful or licentious
elements, with which Japanese popular, and juvenile
literature is saturated. These have been carefully
avoided.</p>

<p>It is also rather with a view to the artistic, than to
the literary, products of the imagination of Japan, that
the selection has been made. From my first acquaintance,
twelve years ago, with Japanese youth, I became
an eager listener to their folk lore and fireside
stories. When later, during a residence of nearly
four years among the people, my eyes were opened
to behold the wondrous fertility of invention, the
wealth of literary, historic and classic allusion, of
pun, myth and riddle, of heroic, wonder, and legendary
lore in Japanese art, I at once set myself to find
the source of the ideas expressed in bronze and porcelain,
on lacquered cabinets, fans, and even crape
paper napkins and tidies. Sometimes I discovered
the originals of the artist's fancy in books, sometimes
only in the mouths of the people and professional
story-tellers. Some of these stories I first read
on the tattooed limbs and bodies of the native foot-runners,
others I first saw in flower-tableaux at the
street floral shows of Tokio. Within this book the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
reader will find translations, condensations of whole
books, of interminable romances, and a few sketches
by the author embodying Japanese ideas, beliefs and
superstitions. I have taken no more liberty, I think,
with the native originals, than a modern story-teller
of Tokio would himself take, were he talking in an
American parlor, instead of at his bamboo-curtained
stand in Yanagi Cho, (Willow Street,) in the
mikado's capital.</p>

<p>Some of the stories have appeared in English before,
but most of them are printed for the first time.
A few reappear from <i>The Independent</i> and other
periodicals.</p>

<p>The illustrations and cover-stamp, though engraved
in New York by Mr. Henry W. Troy, were, with
one exception, drawn especially for this work, by my
artist-friend, Ozawa Nankoku, of Tokio. The picture
of Yorimasa, the Archer, was made for me by
one of my students in Tokio.</p>

<p>Hoping that these harmless stories that have tickled
the imagination of Japanese children during untold
generations, may amuse the big and little folks of
America, the writer invites his readers, in the language
of the native host as he points to the chopsticks
and spread table, <i>O agari nasai</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE of the greatest days in the calendar
of old Japan was the
seventh of July; or, as the Japanese
people put it, "the seventh
day of the seventh month." It
was a vermilion day in the almanacs, to
which every child looked forward with eyes
sparkling, hands clapping, and fingers counting,
as each night rolled the time nearer.
All manner of fruits and other eatable vegetables
were prepared, and cakes baked, in
the household. The boys plucked bamboo
stalks, and strung on their branches bright-colored
ribbons, tinkling bells, and long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
streamers of paper, on which poetry was
written. On this night, mothers hoped for
wealth, happiness, good children, and wisdom.
The girls made a wish that they
might become skilled in needlework. Only
one wish a year, however, could be made.
So, if any one wanted several things&mdash;health,
wealth, skill in needlework, wisdom,
etc.&mdash;they must wait many years before
all the favors could be granted. Above all
things, rainy weather was not desired. It
was a "good sign" when a spider spun his
web over a melon, or, if put in a square box
he should weave a circular web. Now, the
cause of all this preparation was that on the
seventh of July the Herd-boy star and the
Spinning Maiden star cross the Milky Way
to meet each other. These are the stars
which we call Capricornus and Alpha Lyra.
These stars that shine and glitter so far up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
in the zenith, are the boy with an ox and
the girl with a shuttle, about whom the
story runs as follows:</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>On the banks of the Silver River of
Heaven (which we call the Milky Way)
there lived a beautiful maiden, who was the
daughter of the sun. Her name was Shokujo.
She did not care for games or play,
like her companions, and, thinking nothing
of vain display, wore only the simplest of
dress. Yet she was very diligent, and
made many garments for others. Indeed,
so busy was she that all called her the Weaving
or Spinning Princess.</p>

<p>The sun-king noticed the serious disposition
and close habits of his daughter, and
tried in various ways to get her to be more
lively. At last he thought to marry her.
As marriages in the star-land are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
planned by the parents, and not by the foolish
lover-boys and girls, he arranged the
union without consulting his daughter. The
young man on whom the sun-king thus bestowed
his daughter's hand was Kingin, who
kept a herd of cows on the banks of the
celestial stream. He had always been a
good neighbor, and, living on the same side
of the river, the father thought he would
get a nice son-in-law, and at the same time
improve his daughter's habits and disposition.</p>

<p>No sooner did the maiden become wife
than her habits and character utterly
changed for the worse, and the father had a
very vexatious case of <i>tadashiku suguru</i> ("too
much of a good thing") on his hands. The
wife became not only very merry and lively,
but utterly forsook loom and needle. She
gave up her nights and days to play and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
idleness, and no silly lover could have been
more foolish than she.</p>

<p>The sun-king became very much offended
at all this, and thinking that the husband
was the cause of it, he determined to separate
the couple. So he ordered the husband
to remove to the other side of the river of
stars, and told him that hereafter they
should meet only once a year, on the seventh
night of the seventh month. To make a
bridge over the flood of stars, the sun-king
called myriads of magpies, which thereupon
flew together, and, making a bridge, supported
him on their wings and backs as if
it were a roadway of solid land. So, bidding
his weeping wife farewell, the lover-husband
sorrowfully crossed the River of
Heaven. No sooner had he set foot on the
opposite side than the magpies flew away,
filling all the heavens with their chatter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The weeping wife and lover-husband stood
for a long time wistfully gazing at each
other from afar. Then they separated, the
one to lead his ox, the other to ply her shuttle
during the long hours of the day with
diligent toil. Thus they filled the hours,
and the sun-king again rejoiced in his daughter's
industry.</p>

<p>But when night fell, and all the lamps of
heaven were lighted, the lovers would come
and stand by the banks of the starry river,
and gaze longingly at each other, waiting
for the seventh night of the seventh month.</p>

<p>At last the time drew near, and only one
fear possessed the loving wife. Every time
she thought of it her heart played pit-a-pat
faster. What if it should rain? For the
River of Heaven is always full to the brim,
and one extra drop of rain causes a flood
which sweeps away even the bird-bridge.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>But not a drop fell. The seventh month,
seventh night, came, and all the heavens
were clear. The magpies flew joyfully in
myriads, making one way for the tiny feet
of the little lady. Trembling with joy, and
with heart fluttering more than the bridge
of wings, she crossed the River of Heaven,
and was in the arms of her husband. This
she did every year. The lover-husband
stayed on his side of the river, and the wife
came to him on the magpie bridge, save on
the sad occasion when it rained. So every
year the people hope for clear weather, and
the happy festival is celebrated alike by old
and young.</p>

of canals and bridges. Its streets
are full of bustling trade, and its
waterways are ever alive with gondolas,
shooting hither and thither like the wooden
shuttles in a loom. The other is the sacred
city of the Mikado's empire, girdled with
green hills and a nine-fold circle of flowers.
In its quiet, clean streets, laid out like a
chessboard, walk the shaven monks and
gowned scholars. And very beautiful is
Kioto, with pretty girls, and temple gardens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and castle walls, and towers, and moats in
which the white lotus blooms.
</p>
<hr class="hr15" />

<p>Long, long ago, in the good old days before
the hairy-faced and pale-cheeked men
from over the Sea of Great Peace (Pacific
Ocean) came to Japan; before the black
coal-smoke and snorting engine scared the
white heron from the rice-fields; before
black crows and fighting sparrows, which
fear not man, perched on telegraph wires,
or ever a railway was thought of, there lived
two frogs&mdash;one in a well in Kioto, the other
in a lotus-pond in Ozaka.</p>

<p>Now it is a common proverb in the Land
of the Gods (Japan) that "the frog in the
well knows not the great ocean," and the
Kioto frog had so often heard this scornful
sneer from the maids who came to draw out
water, with their long bamboo-handled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
buckets that he resolved to travel abroad
and see the world, and especially the <i>tai kai</i>
(the great ocean).</p>

<p>"I'll see for myself," said Mr. Frog, as he
packed his wallet and wiped his spectacles,
"what this great ocean is that they talk
about. I'll wager it isn't half as deep or
wide as well, where I can see the stars
even at daylight."</p>

<p>Now the truth was, a recent earthquake
had greatly reduced the depth of the well
and the water was getting very shallow.
Mr. Frog informed his family of his intentions.
Mrs. Frog wept a great deal; but,
drying her eyes with her paper handkerchief,
she declared she would count the hours
on her fingers till he came back, and at every
morning and evening meal would set out his
table with food on it, just as if he were home.
She tied up a little lacquered box full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
boiled rice and snails for his journey, wrapped
it around with a silk napkin, and, putting
his extra clothes in a bundle, swung it
on his back. Tying it over his neck, he
seized his staff and was ready to go.</p>

<p>"<i>Sayonara</i>" ("Good-bye") cried he, as,
with a tear in his eye, he walked away.</p>

<p>"<i>Sayonara. Oshidzukani</i>" ("Good-bye.
Walk slowly"), croaked Mrs. Frog and the
whole family of young frogs in a chorus.</p>

<p>Two of the froggies were still babies, that
is, they were yet polywogs, with a half inch
of tail still on them; and, of course, were
carried about by being strapped on the back
of their older brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog being now on land, out of his
well, noticed that the other animals did not
leap, but walked on their legs. And, not
wishing to be eccentric, he likewise began
briskly walking upright on his hind legs or
waddling on all fours.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Now it happened that about the same
time the Ozaka father frog had become restless
and dissatisfied with life on the edges
of his lotus-ditch. He had made up his mind
to "cast the lion's cub into the valley."</p>

<p>"Why! that <i>is</i> tall talk for a frog, I must
say," exclaims the reader. "What did he
mean?"</p>

<p>I must tell you that the Ozaka frog was
a philosopher. Right at the edge of his
lotus-pond was a monastery, full of Buddhist
monks, who every day studied their sacred
rolls and droned over the books of Confucius,
to learn them by heart. Our frog had heard
them so often that he could (in frog language,
of course) repeat many of their wise sentences
and intone responses to their evening
prayers put up by the great idol Amida.
Indeed, our frog had so often listened to
their debates on texts from the classics that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
he had himself become a sage and a philosopher.
Yet, as the proverb says, "the sage
is not happy."</p>

<p>Why not? In spite of a soft mud-bank,
plenty of green scum, stagnant water, and
shady lotus leaves, a fat wife and a numerous
family; in short, everything to make a
frog happy, his forehead, or rather gullet,
was wrinkled with care from long pondering
of knotty problems, such as the following:</p>

<p>The monks often come down to the edge
of the pond to look at the pink and white
lotus. One summer day, as a little frog,
hardly out of his tadpole state, with a small
fragment of tail still left, sat basking on a
huge round leaf, one monk said to the other:</p>

<p>"Of what does that remind you?"</p>

<p>"The babies of frogs will become but
frogs," said one shaven pate, laughing.</p>

<p>"What think you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>"The white lotus flower springs out of the
black mud," said the other, solemnly, as both
walked away.</p>

<p>The old frog, sitting near by, overheard
them and began to philosophize: "Humph!
The babies of frogs will become but frogs,
hey? If mud becomes lotus, why shouldn't
a frog become a man? Why not? If my
pet son should travel abroad and see the
world&mdash;go to Kioto, for instance&mdash;why
shouldn't he be as wise as those shining-headed
men, I wonder? I shall try it, anyhow.
I'll send my son on a journey to Kioto.
I'll 'cast the lion's cub into the valley' (send
the pet son abroad in the world, to see and
study) at once. I'll deny myself for the
sake of my offspring."</p>
</div>

<p>Flump! splash! sounded the water, as a
pair of webby feet disappeared. The "lion's
cub" was soon ready, after much paternal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>advice, and much counsel to beware of being
gobbled up by long-legged storks, and trod
on by impolite men, and struck at by bad
boys. "<i>Kio ni no inaka</i>" ("Even in the
capital there are boors") said Father Frog.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the old frog from
Kioto and the "lion's cub" from Ozaka
started each from his home at the same
time. Nothing of importance occurred to
either of them until, as luck would have it,
they met on a hill near Hashimoto, which
is half way between the two cities. Both
were footsore, and websore, and very tired,
especially about the hips, on account of the
unfroglike manner of walking, instead of
hopping, as they had been used to.</p>

<p>"<i>Ohio gozarimasu</i>" ("Good-morning")
said the "lion's cub" to the old frog, as he
fell on all fours and bowed his head to the
ground three times, squinting up over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>left eye, to see if the other frog was paying
equal deference in return.</p>

<p>"<i>He, konnichi wa</i>" ("Yes, good-day") replied
the Kioto frog.</p>

<p>"<i>O tenki</i>" ("It is rather fine weather to-day")
said the "cub."</p>

<p>"<i>He, yoi tenki gozence</i>" ("Yes, it is very
fine") replied the old fellow.</p>

<p>"I am Gamataro, from Ozaka, the oldest
son of Hiki Dono, Sensui no Kami" (Lord
Bullfrog, Prince of the Lotus-Ditch).</p>

<p>"Your Lordship must be weary with your
journey. I am Kayeru San of Idomidzu
(Sir Frog of the Well) in Kioto. I started
out to see the 'great ocean' from Ozaka; but,
I declare, my hips are so dreadfully tired
that I believe that I'll give up my plan and
content myself with a look from this hill."</p>

<p>The truth must be owned that the old
frog was not only on his hind legs, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
on his last legs, when he stood up to look at
Ozaka; while the "cub" was tired enough
to believe anything. The old fellow, wiping
his face, spoke up:</p>

<p>"Suppose we save ourselves the trouble
of the journey. This hill is half way between
the two cities, and while I see Ozaka
and the sea you can get a good look of the
Kio" (Capital, or Kioto).</p>

<p>"Happy thought!" said the Ozaka frog.</p>

<p>Then both reared themselves upon their
hind-legs, and stretching upon their toes,
body to body, and neck to neck, propped
each other up, rolled their goggles and
looked steadily, as they supposed, on the
places which they each wished to see. Now
everyone knows that a frog has eyes
mounted in that part of his head which is
<span class="smcap">front when he is down and back when he
stands up</span>. They are set like a compass on
gimbals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>Long and steadily they gazed, until, at last,
their toes being tired, they fell down on all
fours.</p>

<p>"I declare!" said the old <i>yaze</i> (daddy)
"Ozaka looks just like Kioto; and as for 'the
great ocean' those stupid maids talked about,
I don't see any at all, unless they mean
that strip of river that looks for all the
world like the Yodo. I don't believe there
is any 'great ocean'!"</p>

<p>"As for my part," said the 'cub', "I am
satisfied that it's all folly to go further; for
Kioto is as like Ozaka as one grain of rice is
like another." Then he said to himself:
"Old Totsu San (my father) is a fool, with
all his philosophy."</p>

<p>Thereupon both congratulated themselves
upon the happy labor-saving expedient by
which they had spared themselves a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>journey, much leg-weariness, and some
danger. They departed, after exchanging
many compliments; and, dropping again
into a frog's hop, they leaped back in half
the time&mdash;the one to his well and the other
to his pond. There each told the story of
both cities looking exactly alike; thus
demonstrating the folly of those foolish folks
called men. As for the old gentleman in
the lotus-pond, he was so glad to get the
"cub" back again that he never again tried
to reason out the problems of philosophy.
And to this day the frog in the well knows
not and believes not in the "great ocean."
Still do the babies of frogs become but frogs.
Still is it vain to teach the reptiles philosophy;
for all such labor is "like pouring
water in a frog's face." Still out of the
black mud springs the glorious white lotus
in celestial purity, unfolding its stainless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>petals to the smiling heavens, the emblem of
life and resurrection.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N among the hills of Echizen,
within sight of the snowy mountain
called Hakuzan, lived a farmer
named Bimbo. He was
very poor, but frugal and industrious.
He was very fond of children
though he had none himself. He longed to
adopt a son to bear his name, and often
talked the matter over with his old dame.
But being so dreadfully poor both thought
it best not to adopt, until they had bettered
their condition and increased the area of
their land. For all the property Bimbo
owned was the earth in a little gully, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
he himself was reclaiming. A tiny rivulet,
flowing from a spring in the crevice of the
rocks above, after trickling over the boulders,
rolled down the gully to join a brook in
the larger valley below. Bimbo had with
great labor, after many years, made dams
or terraces of stone, inside which he had
thrown soil, partly got from the mountain
sides, but mainly carried in baskets on the
backs of himself and his wife, from the
valley below. By such weary toil, continued
year in and year out, small beds of soil
were formed, in which rice could be planted
and grown. The little rivulet supplied the
needful water; for rice, the daily food of
laborer and farmer, must be planted and
cultivated in soft mud under water. So the
little rivulet, which once leaped over the
rock and cut its way singing to the valley,
now spread itself quietly over each terrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
making more than a dozen descents before
it reached the fields below.</p>

<p>Yet after all his toil for a score of years,
working every day from the first croak of
the raven, until the stars came out, Bimbo
and his wife owned only three <i>tan</i> (&frac34; acre)
of terrace land. Sometimes a summer would
pass, and little or no rain fall. Then the
rivulet dried up and crops failed. It seemed
all in vain that their backs were bent and
their foreheads seamed and wrinkled with
care. Many a time did Bimbo have hard
work of it even to pay his taxes, which
sometimes amounted to half his crop. Many
a time did he shake his head, muttering the
discouraged farmer's proverb "A new field
gives a scant crop," the words of which
mean also, "Human life is but fifty years."</p>

<p>One summer day after a long drought,
when the young rice sprouts, just transplanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
were turning yellow at the tips, the clouds
began to gather and roll, and soon a smart
shower fell, the lightning glittered, and the
hills echoed with claps of thunder. But
Bimbo, hoe in hand, was so glad to see the
rain fall, and the pattering drops felt so cool
and refreshing, that he worked on, strengthening
the terrace to resist the little flood
about to come.</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>Pretty soon the storm rattled very near
him, and he thought he had better seek
shelter, lest the thunder should strike and
kill him. For Bimbo, like all his neighbors,
had often heard stories of Kaijin, the
god of the thunder-drums, who lives in the
skies and rides on the storm, and sometimes
kills people by throwing out of the clouds
at them a terrible creature like a cat, with
iron-like claws and a hairy body.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>Just as Bimbo threw his hoe over his
shoulder and started to move, a terrible
blinding flash of lightning dazzled his eyes.
It was immediately followed by a deafening
crash, and the thunder fell just in front of
him. He covered his eyes with his hands,
but finding himself unhurt, uttered a prayer
of thanks to Buddha for safety. Then he
uncovered his eyes and looked down at his
feet.</p>

<p>There lay a little boy, rosy and warm,
and crowing in the most lively manner, and
never minding the rain in the least. The
farmer's eyes opened very wide, but happy
and nearly surprised out of his senses, he
picked up the child tenderly in his arms,
and took him home to his old wife.</p>

<p>"Here's a gift from Raijin," said Bimbo.
"We'll adopt him as our own son and call
him Rai-taro," (the first-born darling of
the thunder).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>So the boy grew up and became a very
dutiful and loving child. He was as kind
and obedient to his foster-parents as though
he had been born in their house. He never
liked to play with other children, but kept
all day in the fields with his father, sporting
with the rivulet and looking at the clouds
and sky. Even when the strolling players
of the Dai Kagura (the comedy which makes
the gods laugh) and the "Lion of Corea"
came into the village, and every boy and
girl and nurse and woman was sure to be
out in great glee, the child of the thunder
stayed up in the field, or climbed on the
high rocks to watch the sailing of the birds
and the flowing of the water and the river
far away.</p>
</div>

<p>Great prosperity seemed to come to the
farmer, and he laid it all to the sweet child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>that fell to him from the clouds. It was
very curious that rain often fell on Bimbo's
field when none fell elsewhere; so that
Bimbo grew rich and changed his name
to Kanemochi. He believed that the boy
Raitaro beckoned to the clouds, and they
shed their rain for him.</p>

<p>A good many summers passed by, and
Raitaro had grown to be a tall and handsome
lad, almost a man and eighteen years
old. On his birthday the old farmer and
the good wife made a little feast for their
foster-child. They ate and drank and talked
of the thunder-storm, out of which Raitaro
was born.</p>

<p>Finally the young man said solemnly:</p>

<p>"My dear parents, I thank you very
much for your kindness to me, but I must
now say farewell. I hope you will always
be happy."</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, all trace of a human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
form disappeared, and floating in the air,
they saw a tiny white dragon, which hovered
for a moment above them, and then
flew away. The old couple went out of
doors to watch it, when it grew bigger and
bigger, taking its course to the hills above,
where the piled-up white clouds, which form
on a summer's afternoon, seemed built up like
towers and castles of silver. Towards one
of these the dragon moved, until, as they
watched his form, now grown to a mighty
size, it disappeared from view.</p>

<p>After this Kanemochi and his wife, who
were now old and white-headed, ceased from
their toil and lived in comfort all their days.
When they died and their bodies were reduced
to a heap of white cinders in the stone
furnace of the village cremation-house, their
ashes were mixed, and being put into one
urn, were laid away in the cemetery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
temple yard. Their tomb was carved in
the form of a white dragon, which to this
day, in spite of mosses and lichens, may
still be seen among the ancient monuments
of the little hamlet.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once an old man who
had a wife with a very bad temper.
She had never borne him
any children, and would not
take the trouble to adopt a son.
So for a little pet he kept a tiny sparrow,
and fed it with great care. The old dame
not satisfied with scolding her husband
hated the sparrow.</p>

<p>Now the old woman's temper was especially
bad on wash days, when her old back
and knees were well strained over the low
tub, which rested on the ground.</p>

<p>It happened once that she had made some
starch, and set it in a red wooden bowl to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
cool. While her back was turned, the sparrow
hopped down on the edge of the bowl,
and pecked at some of the starch. In a rage
the old hag seized a pair of scissors and cut
the sparrow's tongue out. Flinging the
bird in the air she cried out, "Now be off."
So the poor sparrow, all bleeding, flew
away.</p>

<p>When the old man came back and found
his pet gone, he made a great ado. He asked
his wife, and she told him what she had
done and why. The sorrowful old man
grieved sorely for his pet, and after looking
in every place and calling it by name, gave
it up as lost.</p>

<p>Long after this, old man while wandering
on the mountains met his old friend the
sparrow. They both cried "Ohio!" (good
morning,) to each other, and bowing low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
offered many mutual congratulations and inquiries
as to health, etc. Then the sparrow
begged the old man to visit his humble
abode, promising to introduce his wife and
two daughters.</p>

<p>The old man went in and found a nice
little house with a bamboo garden, tiny
waterfall, stepping stone and everything complete.
Then Mrs. Sparrow brought in slices
of sugar-jelly, rock-candy, sweet potato
custard, and a bowl of hot starch sprinkled
with sugar, and a pair of chopsticks on a
tray. Miss Suzumi, the elder daughter
brought the tea caddy and tea-pot, and in
a snap of the fingers had a good cup of tea
ready, which she offered on a tray, kneeling.</p>

<p>"Please take up and help yourself.
The refreshments are very poor, but I hope
you will excuse our plainness," said Mother
Sparrow. The delighted old man, wondering
in himself at such a polite family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
sparrows, ate heartily, and drank several
cups of tea. Finally, on being pressed he
remained all night.</p>

<p>For several days the old man enjoyed
himself at the sparrow's home. He looked
at the landscapes and the moonlight, feasted
to his heart's content, and played <i>go</i> (the
game of 360 checkers) with Ko-suzumi the
little daughter. In the evening Mrs. Sparrow
would bring out the refreshments and
the wine, and seat the old man on a silken
cushion, while she played the guitar. Mr.
Sparrow and his two daughters danced,
sung and made merry. The delighted old
man leaning on the velvet arm-rest forgot
his cares, his old limbs and his wife's
tongue, and felt like a youth again.</p>

<p>On the fifth day the old man said he must
go home. Then the sparrow brought out
two baskets made of plaited rattan, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
are used in traveling and carried on men's
shoulders. Placing them before their guest,
the sparrow said, "Please accept a parting
gift."</p>

<p>Now one basket was very heavy, and the
other very light. The old man, not being
greedy, said he would take the lighter one.
So with many thanks and bows and good-byes,
he set off homewards.</p>

<p>He reached his hut safely, but instead of
a kind welcome the old hag began to scold
him for being away so long. He begged
her to be quiet, and telling of his visit to
the sparrows, opened the basket, while the
scowling old woman held her tongue, out of
sheer curiosity.</p>

<p>Oh, what a splendid sight! There were
gold and silver coin, and gems, and coral,
and crystal, and amber, and the never-failing
bag of money, and the invisible coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
hat, and rolls of books, and all manner of
precious things.</p>

<p>At the sight of so much wealth, the old
hag's scowl changed to a smile of greedy
joy. "I'll go right off and get a present
from the sparrows," said she.</p>

<p>So binding on her straw sandals, and
tucking up her skirts, and adjusting her
girdle, tying the bow in front, she seized her
staff and set off on the road. Arriving at
the sparrow's house she began to flatter Mr.
Sparrow by soft speeches. Of course the
polite sparrow invited her into his house,
but nothing but a cup of tea was offered her,
and wife and daughters kept away. Seeing
she was not going to get any good-bye gift,
the brazen hussy asked for one. The sparrow
then brought out and set before her two
baskets, one heavy and the other light.
Taking the heavier one without so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
saying "thank you," she carried it back
with her. Then she opened it, expecting
all kinds of riches.</p>
</div>

<p>She took off the lid, when a horrible
cuttle-fish rushed at her, and a horned <i>oni</i>
snapped his tusks at her, a skeleton poked
his bony fingers in her face, and finally a
long, hairy serpent, with a big head and
lolling tongue, sprang out and coiled around
her, cracking her bones, and squeezing out
her breath, till she died.</p>

<p>After the good old man had buried his
wife, he adopted a son to comfort his old
age, and with his treasures lived at ease all
his days.</p>

harmless lightning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the species of night-flies, the most
beautiful of all, is a source of much amusement
to the ladies. Hanging the cage of
glittering insects on their verandahs, they
sit and watch the crowd of winged visitors
attracted by the fire-fly's light. What brings
them there, and why the fire-fly's parlor is
filled with suitors as a queen's court with
courtiers, let this love story tell.
</p>
<hr class="hr15" />

<p>On the southern and sunny side of the
castle moats of the Fukui castle, in Echizen,
the water had long ago become shallow
so that lotus lilies grew luxuriantly. Deep
in the heart of one of the great flowers
whose petals were as pink as the lining of
a sea-shell, lived the King of the Fire-flies,
Hi-&#333;, whose only daughter was the lovely
princess Hotaru-him&eacute;. While still a child
the him&eacute; (princess) was carefully kept at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
home within the pink petals of the lily, never
going even to the edges except to see her
father fly off on his journey. Dutifully she
waited until of age, when the fire glowed in
her own body, and shone, beautifully illuminating
the lotus, until its light at night was
like a lamp within a globe of coral.</p>

<p>Every night her light grew brighter and
brighter, until at last it was as mellow as
gold. Then her father said:</p>

<p>"My daughter is now of age, she may fly
abroad with me sometimes, and when the
proper suitor comes she may marry whom
she will."</p>

<p>So Hotaru-him&eacute; flew forth in and out
among the lotus lilies of the moat, then into
rich rice fields, and at last far off to the indigo
meadows.</p>

<p>Whenever she went a crowd of suitors followed
her, for she had the singular power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of attracting all the night-flying insects to
herself. But she cared for none of their attentions,
and though she spoke politely to
them all she gave encouragement to none.
Yet some of the sheeny-winged gallants
called her a coquette.</p>

<p>One night she said to her mother, the
queen:</p>

<p>"I have met many admirers, but I don't
wish a husband from any of them. Tonight
I shall stay at home, and if any of
them love me truly they will come and pay
me court here. Then I shall lay an impossible
duty on them. If they are wise they
will not try to perform it; and if they love
their lives more than they love me, I do not
want any of them. Whoever succeeds may
have me for his bride."</p>

<p>"As you will my child," said the queen
mother, who arrayed her daughter in her
most resplendent robes, and set her on her
throne in the heart of the lotus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she gave orders to her body-guard
to keep all suitors at a respectful distance
lest some stupid gallant, a horn-bug or a
cockchafer dazzled by the light should approach
too near and hurt the princess or
shake her throne.</p>

<p>No sooner had twilight faded away, than
forth came the golden beetle, who stood on
a stamen and making obeisance, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Lord Green-Gold, I offer my
house, my fortune and my love to Princess
Hotaru."</p>

<p>"Go and bring me fire and I will be your
bride" said Hotaru-him&eacute;.</p>

<p>With a bow of the head the beetle opened
his wings and departed with a stately whirr.</p>

<p>Next came a shining bug with wings and
body as black as lamp-smoke, who solemnly
professed his passion.</p>

<p>"Bring me fire and you may have me for
your wife."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Off flew the bug with a buzz.</p>

<p>Pretty soon came the scarlet dragon-fly,
expecting so to dazzle the princess by his
gorgeous colors that she would accept him
at once.</p>

<p>"I decline your offer" said the princess,
"but if you bring me a flash of fire, I'll become
your bride."</p>
</div>

<p>Swift was the flight of the dragon-fly on
his errand, and in came the Beetle with a
tremendous buzz, and ardently plead his suit.</p>

<p>"I'll say 'yes' if you bring me fire" said
the glittering princess.</p>

<p>Suitor after suitor appeared to woo the
daughter of the King of the Fire-flies until
every petal was dotted with them. One
after another in a long troop they appeared.
Each in his own way, proudly, humbly,
boldly, mildly, with flattery, with boasting,
even with tears, each proffered his love, told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
his rank or expatiated on his fortune or
vowed his constancy, sang his tune or played
his music. To every one of her lovers the
princess in modest voice returned the same
answer:</p>

<p>"Bring me fire and I'll be your bride."</p>

<p>So without telling his rivals, each one
thinking he had the secret alone sped away
after fire.</p>

<p>But none ever came back to wed the
princess. Alas for the poor suitors! The
beetle whizzed off to a house near by through
the paper windows of which light glimmered.
So full was he of his passion that thinking
nothing of wood or iron, he dashed his head
against a nail, and fell dead on the ground.</p>

<p>The black bug flew into a room where a
poor student was reading. His lamp was
only a dish of earthenware full of rape seed
oil with a wick made of pith. Knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
nothing of oil the love-lorn bug crawled into
the dish to reach the flame and in a few
seconds was drowned in the oil.</p>

<p>"Nan jaro?" (What's that?) said a thrifty
housewife, sitting with needle in hand, as
her lamp flared up for a moment, smoking
the chimney, and then cracking it; while
picking out the scorched bits she found a
roasted dragon-fly, whose scarlet wings were
all burned off.</p>

<p>Mad with love the brilliant hawk-moth,
afraid of the flame yet determined to win
the fire for the princess, hovered round and
round the candle flame, coming nearer and
nearer each time. "Now or never, the
princess or death," he buzzed, as he darted
forward to snatch a flash of flame, but singeing
his wings, he fell helplessly down, and
died in agony.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>"What a fool he was, to be sure," said
the ugly clothes moth, coming on the spot,
"I'll get the fire. I'll crawl up <i>inside</i> the
candle." So he climbed up the hollow paper
wick, and was nearly to the top, and inside
the hollow blue part of the flame, when
the man, snuffing the wick, crushed him to
death.</p>

<p>Sad indeed was the fate of the lovers of
Hi-&#333;'s daughter. Some hovered around the
beacons on the headland, some fluttered
about the great wax candles which stood
eight feet high in their brass sockets in
Buddhist temples; some burned their noses
at the top of incense sticks, or were nearly
choked by the smoke; some danced all
night around the lanterns in the shrines;
some sought the sepulchral lamps in the
graveyard; one visited the cremation furnace;
another the kitchen, where a feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
was going on; another chased the sparks
that flew out of the chimney; but none
brought fire to the princess, or won the
lover's prize. Many lost their feelers, had
their shining bodies scorched or their wings
singed, but most of them alas! lay dead,
black and cold next morning.</p>

<p>As the priests trimmed the lamps in the
shrines, and the servant maids the lanterns,
each said alike:</p>

<p>"The Princess Hotaru must have had
many lovers last night."</p>

<p>Alas! alas! poor suitors. Some tried to
snatch a streak of green fire from the cat's
eyes, and were snapped up for their pains.
One attempted to get a mouthful of bird's
breath, but was swallowed alive. A carrion
beetle (the ugly lover) crawled off to the
sea shore, and found some fish scales that
emitted light. The stag-beetle climbed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
mountain, and in a rotten tree stump found
some bits of glowing wood like fire, but the
distance was so great that long before they
reached the castle moat it was daylight, and
the fire had gone out; so they threw their
fish scales and old wood away.</p>

<p>The next day was one of great mourning
and there were so many funerals going on,
that Hi-mar&#333; the Prince of the Fire-flies on
the north side of the castle moat inquired
of his servants the cause. Then he learned
for the first time of the glittering princess.
Upon this the prince who had just succeeded
his father upon the throne fell in love
with the princess and resolved to marry
her. He sent his chamberlain to ask of her
father his daughter in marriage according
to true etiquette. The father agreed to the
prince's proposal, with the condition that
the Prince should obey her behest in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
thing, which was to come in person bringing
her fire.</p>

<p>Then the Prince at the head of his glittering
battalions came in person and filled the
lotus palace with a flood of golden light.
But Hotaru-him&eacute; was so beautiful that her
charms paled not their fire even in the blaze
of the Prince's glory. The visit ended in
wooing, and the wooing in wedding. On
the night appointed, in a palanquin made of
the white lotus-petals, amid the blazing
torches of the prince's battalions of warriors,
Hotaru-him&eacute; was borne to the prince's palace
and there, prince and princess were joined
in the wedlock.</p>

<p>Many generations have passed since
Hi-mar&#333; and Hotaru-him&eacute; were married,
and still it is the whim of all Fire-fly princesses
that their base-born lovers must
bring fire as their love-offering or lose their
prize. Else would the glittering fair ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
be wearied unto death by the importunity
of their lovers. Great indeed is the loss,
for in this quest of fire many thousand insects,
attracted by the fire-fly, are burned to
death in the vain hope of winning the fire
that shall gain the cruel but beautiful one
that fascinates them. It is for this cause
that each night insects hover around the
lamp flame, and every morning a crowd of
victims drowned in the oil, or scorched in
the flame, must be cleaned from the lamp.
This is the reason why young ladies catch
and imprison the fire-flies to watch the war
of insect-love, in the hope that they may
have human lovers who will dare as much,
through fire and flood, as they.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N THE LAND where neither the
monkeys or the cats have tails,
and the persimmons grow to be
as large as apples and with seeds
bigger than a melon's, there once
lived a land crab in the side of a sand hill.
One day an ape came along having a persimmon
seed, which he offered to swap with
the crab for a rice-cake. The crab agreed,
and planting the seed in his garden went
out every day to watch it grow.</p>

<p>By-and-by the ape came to visit the crab,
and seeing the fine tree laden with the yellow-brown
fruit, begged a few. The crab,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
asking pardon of the ape, said he could not
climb the tree to offer him any, but agreed
to give the ape half, if he would mount the
tree and pluck them.</p>

<p>So the monkey ran up the tree, while the
crab waited below, expecting to eat the ripe
fruit. But the monkey sitting on a limb
first filled his pockets full, and then picking
off all the best ones, greedily ate the pulp,
and threw the skin and stones in the crab's
face. Every once in a while, he would pull
off a green sour persimmon and hit the crab
hard, until his shell was nearly cracked. At
last the crab thought he would get the best
of the ape. So when his enemy had eaten
his fill until he was bulged out, he cried out,</p>

<p>"Now Mister Ape, I dare you to come
down head-foremost. You can't do it."</p>

<p>So the ape began to descend, head downward.
This was just what the crab wanted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
for all the finest persimmons rolled out of
his pockets on the ground. The crab quickly
gathered them up, and with both arms
full ran off to his hole. Then the ape was
very angry. He kindled a fire, and blew
the smoke down the hole, until the crab was
nearly choked. The poor crab to save his
life had to crawl out.</p>

<p>Then the monkey beat him soundly, and
left him for dead.</p>

<p>The crab had not been long thus, when
three travelers, a rice-mortar, an egg, and a
wasp found him lying on the ground. They
carried him into the house, bound up his
wounds and while he lay in bed they planned
how they might destroy the ape. They all
talked of the matter over their cups of tea,
and after the mortar had smoked several
pipes of tobacco, a plan was agreed on.</p>

<p>So taking the crab along, stiff and sore as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was, they marched to the monkey's castle.
The wasp flew inside, and found that their
enemy was away from home. Then all
entered and hid themselves. The egg cuddled
up under the ashes in the hearth. The
wasp flew into the closet. The mortar hid
behind the door. They then waited for the
ape to come home. The crab sat beside the
fire.</p>

<p>Towards evening the monkey arrived,
and throwing off his coat (which was just
what the wasp wanted) he lighted a sulphur
match, and kindling a fire, hung on the
kettle for a cup of tea, and pulled out his
pipe for a smoke. Just as he sat down by
the hearth to salute the crab, the egg burst
and the hot yolk flew all over him and in
his eye, nearly blinding him. He rushed
out to the bath-room to plunge in the tub
of cold water, when the wasp flew at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and stung his nose. Slipping down, he fell
flat on the floor, when the mortar rolled on
him and crushed him to death. Then the
whole party congratulated the crab on their
victory. Grateful for the friendship thus
shown, the whole party, crab, mortar and
wasp lived in peace together.</p>

<p>The crab married the daughter of a rich
crab that lived over the hill, and a great
feast of persimmons was spread before the
bride's relatives who came to see the ceremony.
By-and-by a little crab was born
which became a great pet with the mortar
and wasp. With no more apes to plague
them, they lived very happily.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG TIME AGO there was an
old priest who lived in the
temple of Morinji in the province
of Hitachi. He cooked his own
rice, boiled his own tea, swept
his own floor and lived frugally as an honest
priest should do.</p>

<p>One day he was sitting near the square
fire-place in the middle of the floor. A rope
and chain to hold the pot and kettle hung
down from the covered hole in the ceiling
which did duty as a chimney. A pair of
brass tongs was stuck in the ashes and the
fire blazed merrily. At the side of the fire-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>place,
on the floor, was a tray filled with
tiny tea-cups, a pewter tea-caddy, a bamboo
tea-stirrer, and a little dipper. The priest
having finished sweeping the ashes off the
edges of the hearth with a little whisk of
hawk's feathers, was just about to put on
the tea when "suzz," "suzz," sang the tea-kettle
spout; and then "pattari"&mdash;"pattari"
said the lid, as it flapped up and down, and
the kettle swung backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" said the old
bonze. "<i>Naru hodo</i>," said he, with a start
as the spout of the kettle turned into a
badger's nose with its big whiskers, while
from the other side sprouted out a long
bushy tail.</p>

<p>"<i>Yohodo medzurashi</i>," shouted the priest
dropping the tea-caddy and spilling the green
tea all over the matting as four hairy legs
appeared under the kettle, and the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
compound, half badger and half kettle,
jumped off the fire, and began running
around the room. To the priest's horror it
leaped on a shelf, puffed out its belly and
began to beat a tune with its fore-paws as if
it were a drum. The old bonze's pupils,
hearing the racket rushed in, and after a
lively chase, upsetting piles of books and
breaking some of the tea-cups, secured the
badger, and squeezed him in a keg used for
storing the pickled radishes called <i>daikon</i>,
(or Japanese sauer-kraut.) They fastened
down the lid with a heavy stone. They
were sure that the strong odor of the radishes
would kill the beast, for no man could possibly
survive such a smell, and it was not
likely a badger could.</p>

<p>The next morning the tinker of the village
called in and the priest told him about
his strange visitor. Wishing to show him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the animal, he cautiously lifted the lid of the
cask, lest the badger, might after all, be still
alive, in spite of the stench of the sour
mess, when lo! there was nothing but the
old iron tea-kettle. Fearing that the utensil
might play the same prank again, the priest
was glad to sell it to the tinker who bought
the kettle for a few iron cash. He carried
it to his junk shop, though he thought it felt
unusually heavy.</p>

<p>The tinker went to bed as usual that
night with his <i>andon</i>, or paper shaded lamp,
just back of his head. About midnight,
hearing a strange noise like the flapping up
and down of an iron pot-lid, he sat up in
bed, rubbed his eyes, and there was the iron
pot covered with fur and sprouting out legs.
In short, it was turning into a hairy beast.
Going over to the recess and taking a fan
from the rack, the badger climbed up on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
frame of the lamp, and began to dance on its
one hind leg, waving the fan with its fore-paw.
It played many other tricks, until the
man started up, and then the badger turned
into a tea-kettle again.</p>

<p>"I declare," said the tinker as he woke
up next morning, and talked the matter over
with his wife. "I'll just 'raise a mountain'"
(earn my fortune) on this kettle. It certainly
is a very highly accomplished tea-kettle
I'll call it the Bumbuku Chagama (The Tea-Kettle
accomplished in literature and military
art) and exhibit it to the public.</p>

<p>So the tinker hired a professional show-man
for his business agent, and built a little
theatre and stage. Then he gave an order
to a friend of his, an artist, to paint scenery,
with Fuji yama and cranes flying in the air,
and a crimson sun shining through the
bamboo, and a red moon rising over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
waves, and golden clouds and tortoises, and
the Sumiyoshi couple, and the grasshopper's
picnic, and the Procession of Lord Long-legs,
and such like. Then he stretched a tight
rope of rice-straw across the stage, and the
handbills being stuck up in all the barber
shops in town, and wooden tickets branded
with "Accomplished and Lucky Tea-Kettle
Performance, Admit one,"&mdash;the show
was opened. The house was full and the
people came in parties bringing their tea-pots
full of tea and picnic boxes full of rice
and eggs, and dumplings, made of millet
meal, sugared roast-pea cakes, and other
refreshments; because they came to stay all
day. Mothers brought their babies with
them for the children enjoyed it most of all.</p>

<p>Then the tinker, dressed up in his wide
ceremonial clothes, with a big fan in his
hand, came out on the platform, made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
bow and set the wonderful tea-kettle on the
stage. Then at a wave of his fan, the kettle
ran around on four legs, half badger and
half iron, clanking its lid and wagging its tail.
Next it turned into a badger, swelled out its
body and beat a tune on it like a drum. It
danced a jig on the tight rope, and walked
the slack rope, holding a fan, or an umbrella
in his paw, stood on his head, and finally at
a flourish of his master's fan became a cold
and rusty tea-kettle again. The audience
were wild with delight, and as the fame of
the wonderful tea-kettle spread, many people
came from great distances.</p>
</div>

<p>Year after year the tinker exhibited the
wonder until he grew immensely rich. Then
he retired from the show business, and out
of gratitude took the old kettle to the temple
again and deposited it there as a precious
relic. It was then named Bumbuku Dai
Mio Jin (The Great Illustrious, Accomplished
in Literature and the Military Art).</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">V</span>ERY LONG, LONG AGO, there
lived an old man and woman in
a village near a mountain, from
which flowed a stream of purest
water. This old couple loved
each other so dearly and lived together so
happily, that the neighbors called them
<i>oshi-dori fu-fu</i> (a love-bird couple), after
the mandarin ducks which always dwell
together in pairs, and are so affectionate
that they are said to pine and die if one be
taken from the other. The old man was a
woodcutter, and the old woman kept house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
but they were very lonely for they had no
child, and often grieved over their hard lot.</p>

<p>One day while the man was out on the
mountain cutting brush, his old crone took
her shallow tub and clothes down to the
brook to wash. She had not yet begun,
when she saw a peach floating with its stem
and two leaves in the stream. She picked
up the fruit and set it aside to take home
and share it with her old man. When he
returned she set it before him, not dreaming
what was in it. He was just about to cut
it open, when the peach fell in half, and
there lay a little baby boy. The happy old
couple rejoiced over him and reared him
tenderly. Because he was their first child
(taro) and born of a peach (momo) they
called him Momotar&#333; or Peach-Darling.</p>

<p>The most wonderful thing in the child,
was his great strength! Even when still a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
baby, he would astonish his foster-mother
by standing on the mats, and lifting her
wash tub, or kettle of hot tea, which he
would balance above his head without spilling
a drop. The little fellow grew to be
strong and brave and good. He was always
kind to his parents and saved them many
a step and much toil. He practiced
archery, wrestling, and handling the iron
club, until he was not afraid of anybody or
anything. He even laughed at the oni, who,
were demons living in the clouds or on lonely
islands in the sea. Momotar&#333; was also
very kind to birds and animals, so that they
were very tame, and became his friends,
knew him and called him by name.</p>

<p>Now there was an island far out in the
ocean, inhabited by onis with horns in their
heads, and big sharp tusks in their mouths,
who ravaged the shores of Japan and ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
up the people. In the centre of the island
was the giant Oni's castle, built inside a
great cave which was full of all kinds of
treasures such as every one wants. These
are:</p>

<p>1. The hat which makes the one who
puts it on invisible. It looks just like a
straw hat, but has a tuft of fine grass on
the top, and a pink fringe like the lining of
shells, around the brim.</p>

<p>2. A coat like a farmer's grass rain-cloak,
which makes the wearer invisible.</p>

<p>3. The crystal jewels which flash fire,
and govern the ebb and flow of the tide.</p>

<p>4. Shipp&#333;, or "the seven jewels," namely
gold and silver, branch of red coral, agate,
emerald, crystal and pearl. All together
called <i>takare mono</i>, or precious treasures.</p>

<p>Momotaro made up his mind to conquer
these demons, and get their treasures. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
prepared his weapons and asked the old
woman to make him some millet dumplings.
So the old lady ground the millet seeds into
meal, the old man kneaded the dough, and
both made the dumplings which the little
hero carefully stuck on skewers and stowed
away in a bamboo basket-box. This he
wrapped in a silk napkin, and flung it over
his shoulder. Seizing his iron club he stuck
his flag in his back as the sign of war. The
flag was of white silk, crossed by two black
bars at the top, and underneath these, was
embroidered the device of a peach with a
stem and two leaves floating on a running
stream. This was his crest or <i>sashimono</i>
(banneret). Then he bade the old folks
good-bye and walked off briskly. He took
his little dog with him, giving him a millet
dumpling now and then.</p>
</div>

<p>As he passed along he met a monkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
chattering and showing his teeth. The
monkey said,</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Mr. Peach-Darling?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to the <i>oni's</i> island to get his
treasures."</p>

<p>"What have you got good in your package?"</p>

<p>"Millet dumplings. Have one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, give me one, and I'll go with you,"
said the monkey.</p>

<p>So the monkey ate the dumpling, and boy,
dog and monkey all trudged on together. A
little further on a pheasant met them and
said:</p>

<p>"Ohio, Momotar&#333;, doko?" (Good morning,
Mr. Peach-Prince, where are you going?).
Peach-Prince told him, and at the same time
offered him a dumpling. This made the
pheasant his friend.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>Peach-Prince and his little army of three
retainers journeyed on until they reached
the sea-shore. There they found a big boat
into which Peach-Prince with the dog and
monkey embarked, while the pheasant flew
over to the island to find a safe place to
land, so as to take the onis by surprise.</p>

<p>They quietly reached the door of the
cave, and then Momotar&#333; beat in the gate
with his iron club. Rushing into the castle,
he put the small onis to flight, and dashing
forward, the little hero would nearly have
reached the room where the giant oni was
just waking up after a nights' drunkenness.
With a terrible roar he advanced to gobble
up Peach-Prince, when the dog ran behind
and bit the oni in the leg. The monkey
climbed up his back and blinded him with
his paws while the pheasant flew in his face.
Then Peach-Prince beat him with his iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
club, until he begged for his life and
promised to give up all his treasures.</p>

<p>The onis brought all their precious things
out of the storehouse and laid them on
great tables or trays before the little hero
and his little army.</p>

<p>Momotaro sat on a rock, with his little
army of three retainers around him, holding
his fan, with his hands akimbo on his knees,
just as mighty generals do after a battle,
when they receive the submission of their
enemies. On his right sat kneeling on the
ground his faithful monkey, while the
pheasant and dog sat on the left.</p>

<p>After the onis had surrendered all, they
fell down on their hands and knees with
their faces in the dust, and acknowledged
Peach-Prince as their master, and swore
they would ever henceforth be his slaves.
Then Peach-Prince, with a wave of his fan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
bade them rise up and carry the treasures to
the largest ship they had, and to point the
prow to the land. This done, Momotaro and
his company got on board, and the onis
bowed farewell.</p>

<p>A stiff breeze sprang up and sent the ship
plowing through the waters, and bent out
the great white sail like a bow. On the prow
was a long black tassel like the mane of a
horse, that at every lurch dipped in the
waves, and as it rose flung off the spray.</p>

<p>The old couple becoming anxious after
their Peach-Darling, had traveled down to
the sea shore, and arrived just as the treasure
ship hove in sight. Oh how beautiful it
looked with its branches of red coral, and
shining heaps of gold and silver, and the invisible
coat and hat, the dazzling sheen of
the jewels of the ebbing and the flowing
tide, the glistening pearls, and piles of agate
and crystal.

<p>Momotaro came home laden with riches
enough to keep the old couple in comfort all
their lives, and he himself lived in great
state. He knighted the monkey, the dog
and the pheasant, and made them his body-guard.
Then he married a beautiful princess
and lived happily till he died.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is a certain mountainous
district in Shikoku in which a
skillful hunter had trapped or
shot so many foxes and badgers
that only a few were left. These
were an old grey badger and a female fox
with one cub. Though hard pressed by
hunger, neither dared to touch a loose piece
of food, lest a trap might be hidden under
it. Indeed they scarcely stirred out of their
holes except at night, lest the hunter's arrow
should strike them. At last the two animals
held a council together to decide what
to do, whether to emigrate or to attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
outwit their enemy. They thought a long
while, when finally the badger having hit
upon a good plan, cried out:</p>

<p>"I have it. Do you transform yourself
into a man. I'll pretend to be dead. Then
you can bind me up and sell me in the town.
With the money paid you can buy some
food. Then I'll get loose and come back.
The next week I'll sell you and you can
escape."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! <i>yoroshiu</i>, <i>yoroshiu</i>," (good,
good,) cried both together. "It's a capital
plan," said Mrs. Fox.</p>

<p>So the Fox changed herself into a human
form, and the badger, pretending to be dead,
was tied up with straw ropes.</p>

<p>Slinging him over her shoulder, the fox
went to town, sold the badger, and buying
a lot of <i>tofu</i> (bean-cheese) and one or two
chickens, made a feast. By this time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
badger had got loose, for the man to whom
he was sold, thinking him dead, had not
watched him carefully. So scampering away
to the mountains he met the fox, who congratulated
him, while both feasted merrily.</p>

<p>The next week the badger took human
form, and going to town sold the fox, who
made believe to be dead. But the badger
being an old skin-flint, and very greedy,
wanted all the money and food for himself.
So he whispered in the man's ear to watch
the fox well as she was only feigning to be
dead. So the man taking up a club gave
the fox a blow on the head, which finished
her. The badger, buying a good dinner,
ate it all himself, and licked his chops,
never even thinking of the fox's cub.</p>

<p>The cub after waiting a long time for its
mother to come back, suspected foul play,
and resolved on revenge. So going to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
badger he challenged him to a trial of skill
in the art of transformation. The badger
accepted right off, for he despised the cub
and wished to be rid of him.</p>

<p>"Well what do you want to do first? said
Sir Badger."</p>

<p>"I propose that you go and stand on the
Big Bridge leading to the city," said the
cub, "and wait for my appearance. I shall
come in splendid garments, and with many
followers in my train. If you recognize
me, you win, and I lose. If you fail, I win."</p>

<p>So the badger went and waited behind a
tree. Soon a daimio riding in a palanquin,
with a splendid retinue of courtiers appeared,
coming up the road. Thinking this was
the fox-cub changed into a nobleman,
although wondering at the skill of the young
fox, the badger went up to the palanquin and
told the person inside that he was recognized
and had lost the game.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>"What!" said the daimio's followers,
who were real men, and surrounding the
badger, they beat him to death.</p>

<p>The fox-cub, who was looking on from a
hill near by, laughed in derision, and glad
that treachery was punished, scampered
away.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY child knows who the <i>Shichi
fuku Fin</i> or seven Patrons
of Happiness are. They have
charge of Long Life, Riches,
Daily Food, Contentment,
Talents, Glory, and Love. Their images
carved in ivory, wood, stone, or cast in bronze
are found in every house or sold in the stores
or are painted on shop signs or found in
picture books. They are a jolly company
and make a happy family. On New Year's
eve a picture of the Treasure-ship (Takar&eacute;-bun&eacute;)
laden with shipp&#333; (the seven jewels)
and all the good things of life which men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
most desire is hung up in houses. The ship
is coming into port and the passengers are
the seven happy fairies who will make gifts
to the people. These seven jewels are the
same as those which Momotaro brought
back from the oni's island.</p>

<p>First there is Fukoruku Jin the patron of
Long Life or Length of Days. He has an
enormously high forehead rounded at the
top which makes his head look like a sugar-loaf.
It is bald and shiny. A few stray
white hairs sometimes sprout up, and the
barber to reach them has to prop a ladder
against his head to climb up and apply his
razor. This big head comes from thinking
so much. His eyebrows are cotton-white,
and a long snowy beard falls down over his
breast.</p>

<p>Once in a while in a good humor he ties
a handkerchief over his high slippery crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and allows little boys to climb up on top&mdash;that
is if they are good and can write well.</p>

<p>When he wants to show how strong and
lively he is even though so old, he lets
Daikoku the fat fellow ride on top of his head,
while he smokes his pipe and wades across
a river. Daikoku has to hold on tightly or
he will slip down and get a ducking.</p>

<p>Usually the old shiny head is a very
solemn gentleman, and walks slowly along
with his staff in one hand while with the
other he strokes his long eyebrows. The
tortoise and the crane are always with him,
for these are his pets. Sometimes a stag
with hair white with age, walks behind him.
Every body likes Fukoruku Jin because
every one wants to get his favor and live
long; until, like a lobster, their backs are
bent with age. At a wedding you will
always see a picture of white-bearded and
shiny-pated Fukoruku Jin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>Daikoku is a short chubby fellow with
eyes half sunk in fat but twinkling with fun.
He has a flat cap set on his head like the
kind which babies wear, a loose sack over
his shoulders, and big boots on his feet.
His throne is two straw bags of rice, and
his badge of office is a mallet or hammer,
which makes people rich when he shakes it.
The hammer is the symbol of labor, showing
that people may expect to get rich only
by hard work. One end of it is carved to
represent the jewel of the ebbing and the
flowing tides, because merchants get rich by
commerce on the sea and must watch the
tides. He is often seen holding the arithmetic
frame on which you can count, do sums,
subtract, multiply, or divide, by sliding balls
up and down a row of sticks set in a frame,
instead of writing figures. Beside him is a
ledger and day-book. His favorite animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
is the rat, which like some rich men's pets,
eats or runs away with his wealth.</p>

<p>The great silver-white radish called
daikon, two feet long and as big as a man's
calf is always seen near him because it signifies
flourishing prosperity.</p>

<p>He keeps his bag tightly shut, for money
easily runs away when the purse is once
opened. He never lets go his hammer, for
it is only by constant care that any one can
keep money after he gets it. Even when
he frolics with Fukuroku Jin, and rides on
his head, he keeps his hammer ready swinging
at his belt. He has huge lop ears.</p>

<p>Once in a while, when he wishes to take
exercise, and Fukuroku Jin wants to show
how frisky he can be, even if he is old, they
have a wrestling match together. Daikoku
nearly always beats, because Fukuroku Jin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
is so tall that he has to bend down to grip
Daikoku, who is fat and short, and thus he
becomes top-heavy. Then Daikoku gets
his rival's long head under his left arm,
seizes him over his back by the belt, and
throws him over his shoulder flat on the
ground. But if Fukuroku Jin can only get
hold of Daikoku's lop ears, both fall together.
Then they laugh heartily and try
it again.</p>

<p>Ebisu is the patron of daily food, which is
rice and fish, and in old times was chiefly
fish. He is nearly as fat as Daikoku, but
wears a court noble's high cap. He is always
fishing or enjoying his game. When very
happy, he sits on a rock by the sea, with his
right leg bent under him, and a big red fish,
called the tai, under his left arm. He carries
a straw wallet on his back to hold his
fish and keep it fresh. Often he is seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
standing knee-deep in the water, pole in
hand, watching for a nibble. Some say that
Ebisu is the same scamp that goes by the
other name of Sosano&#333;.</p>
</div>

<p>Hotei is the patron of contentment, and
of course is the father of happiness. He
does not wear much clothing, for the truth
is that all his property consists of an old,
ragged wrapper, a fan, and a wallet. He is
as round as a pudding, and as fat as if rolled
out of dough. His body is like a lump of
<i>mochi</i> pastry, and his limbs like <i>dango</i> dumplings.
He has lop ears that hang down over
his shoulders, a tremendous double chin,
and a round belly. Though he will not let
his beard grow long, the slovenly old fellow
never has it shaven when he ought to. He
is a jolly vagabond, and never fit for company;
but he is a great friend of the children,
who romp over his knees and shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
pull his ears and climb up over his
shaven head. He always keeps something
good for them in his wallet. Sometimes he
opens it wide, and then makes them guess
what is inside. They try to peep in but
are not tall enough to look over the edge.
He makes tops, paints pictures or kites for
the boys, and is the children's greatest
friend. When the seven patrons meet together,
Hotei is apt to drink more wine
than is good for him.</p>

<p>Toshitoku is almost the only one of the
seven who never lays aside his dignity. He
has a very grave countenance. He is the
patron of talents. His pet animal is a spotted
fawn. He travels about a good deal to
find and reward good boys, who are diligent
in their studies, and men who are fitted to
rule. In one hand he carries a crooked
staff of bamboo, at the top of which is hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a book or roll of manuscript. His dress is
like that of a learned doctor, with square
cap, stole, and high-toed slippers.</p>

<p>Bishamon is the patron of glory and fame.
He is a mighty soldier, with a golden helmet,
breastplate and complete armor. He is the
protector of priests and warriors. He
gives them skill in fencing, horsemanship
and archery. He holds a pagoda in one
hand and a dragon sword in the other. His
pet animal is the tiger.</p>

<p>Six out of the jolly seven worthies are
men. Benten is the only lady. She is the
patron of the family and of the sea. She
plays the flute and the guitar for the others,
and amuses them at their feasts, sometimes
even dancing for them. Her real home is
in Riu Gu, and she is the Queen of the world
under the sea. She often dwells in the sea
or ocean caves. Her favorite animal is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
snake, and her servants are the dragons.</p>

<p>Once a year the jolly seven meet together
to talk over old times, relate their adventures,
and have a supper together. Then
they proceed to business, which is to arrange
all the marriages for the coming year. They
have a great many hanks of red and white
silk, which are the threads of fate of those
to be married: The white threads are the
men, the red are the women. At first they
select the threads very carefully, and tie a
great many pairs or couples neatly and
strongly together, so that the matches are
perfect. All such marriages of threads
make happy marriages among human beings.
But by-and-by they get tired, and lazy, and
instead of tying the knots carefully, they
hurry up the work and then jumble them
carelessly, and finally toss and tangle up all
the rest in a muss.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>This is the reason why so many marriages
are unhappy.</p>

<p>Then they begin to frolic like big boys.
Benten plays the guitar, and Bishamon lies
down on the floor resting with his elbows to
hear it. Hotei drinks wine out of a shallow
red cup as wide as a dinner plate. Daikoku
and Fukuroku Jin begin to wrestle, and
when Daikoku gets his man down, he pounds
his big head with an empty gourd while
Toshitoku and Ebisu begin to eat tai fish.
When this fun is over, Benten and Fukuroku
Jin play a game of checkers, while the
others look on and bet; except Hotei the
fat fellow, who is asleep. Then they get
ashamed of themselves for gambling, and
after a few days the party breaks up and
each one goes to his regular business again.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG WHILE AGO, when the
idols of Buddha and his host of
disciples came to Japan, after
traveling through China from
India, they were very much
vexed because the people still liked the little
black fellow named Daikoku. Even when
they became Buddhists they still burned incense
to Daikoku, because he was the patron
of wealth; for everybody then, as now,
wanted to be rich. So the Buddhist idols
determined to get rid of the little fat fellow.
How to do it was the question. At last they
called Yemma, the judge of the lower regions,
and gave him the power to destroy Daikoku.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>Now Yemma had under him a whole
legion of <i>oni</i>, some green, some black, others
blue as indigo, and others of a vermillion
color, which he usually sent on ordinary
errands.</p>

<p>But for so important an expedition he
now called Shino a very cunning old fellow,
and ordered him to kill or remove Daikoku
out of the way.</p>

<p>Shino made his bow to his master,
tightened his tiger-skin belt around his
loins and set off.</p>

<p>It was not an easy thing to find Daikoku,
even though every one worshipped him.
So the oni had to travel a long way, and
ask a great many questions of people, and
often lose his way before he got any clue.
One day he met a sparrow who directed
him to Daikoku's palace, where among all
his money-bags and treasure piled to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
ceiling, the fat and lop-eared fellow was
accustomed to sit eating daikon radish, and
amuse himself with his favorite pets, the
rats. Around him was stored in straw bags
his rice which he considered more precious
than money.</p>

<p>Entering the gate, the oni peeped about
cautiously but saw no one. He went
further on till he came to a large store
house standing alone and built in the shape
of a huge rice-measure. Not a door or window
could be seen, but climbing up a narrow
plank set against the top edge he peeped
over, and there sat Daikoku.</p>

<p>The oni descended and got into the room.
Then he thought it would be an easy thing
to pounce upon Daikoku. He was already
chuckling to himself over the prospect of
such wealth being his own, when Daikoku
squeaked out to his chief rat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>Nedzumi san</i>, (Mr. Rat) I feel some
strange creature must be near. Go chase
him off the premises."</p>

<p>Away scampered the rat to the garden
and plucked a sprig of holly with leaves full
of thorns like needles. With this in his
fore-paw, he ran at the oni, whacked him
soundly, and stuck him all over with the
sharp prickles.</p>

<p>The oni yelling with pain ran away as
fast as he could run. He was so frightened
that he never stopped until he reached
Yemma's palace, when he fell down breathless.
He then told his master the tale of
his adventure, but begged that he might
never again be sent against Daikoku.</p>

<p>So the Buddhist idols finding they could
not banish or kill Daikoku, agreed to recognize
him, and so they made peace with him
and to this day Buddhists and Shint&#333;ists
alike worship the fat little god of wealth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>When people heard how the chief oni had
been driven away by only a rat armed with
holly, they thought it a good thing to keep
off all oni. So ever afterward, even to this
day, after driving out all the bad creatures
with parched beans, they place sprigs of
holly at their door-posts on New Year's eve,
to keep away the oni and all evil spirits.</p>

<p>Over two thousand years ago, say the
bonzes, it hung in the temple of Gihon Shoja
in India which Buddha built. After his
death it got into the possession of the Dragon
King of the World under the Sea. When
the hero Toda the Archer shot the enemy
of the queen of the Under-world, she presented
him with many treasures and among
them this great bell, which she caused to be
landed on the shores of the lake. Toda
however was not able to remove it, so he
presented it to the monks at Miidera. With
great labor it was brought to the hill-top
and hung in this belfry where it rung out
daily matins and orisons, filling the lake
and hill sides with sweet melody.</p>

<p>Now it was one of the rules of the Buddhists
that no woman should be allowed to
ascend the hill or enter the monastery of
Miidera. The bonzes associated females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and wicked influences together. Hence the
prohibition.</p>

<p>A noted beauty of Kioto hearing of the
polished face of the bell, resolved in spite
of the law against her sex to ascend the hill
to dress her hair and powder her face in the
mirror-like surface of the bell.</p>

<p>So selecting an hour when she knew the
priests would be too busy at study of the
sacred rolls to notice her, she ascended the
hill and entered the belfry. Looking into
the smooth surface, she saw her own sparkling
eyes, her cheeks, flushed rosy with exercise,
her dimples playing, and then her
whole form reflected as in her own silver
mirror, before which she daily sat.
Charmed as much by the vastness as the
brilliancy of the reflection, she stretched
forth her hand, and touching her finger-tips
to the bell prayed aloud that she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
possess just such a mirror of equal size and
brightness.</p>

<p>But the bell was outraged at the impiety
of the woman's touch, and the cold metal
shrank back, leaving a hollow place, and
spoiling the even surface of the bell. From
that time forth the bell gradually lost its
polish, and became dull and finally dark like
other bells.</p>

<p>When Benkei was a monk, he was possessed
of a mighty desire to steal this bell and hang
it up at Hiyeisan. So one night he went over
to Miidera hill and cautiously crept up to
the belfry and unhooked it from the great
iron link which held it. How to get it
down the mountain was now the question.</p>

<p>Should he let it roll down, the monks at
Miidera would hear it bumping over the
stones. Nor could he carry it in his arms,
for it was too big around (16 feet) for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to grasp and hold. He could not put his
head in it like a candle in a snuffer, for then
he would not be able to see his way down.</p>

<p>So climbing into the belfry he pulled out
the cross-beam with the iron link, and hanging
on the bell put the beam on his shoulder
to carry it in <i>tembimbo</i> style, that is, like a
pair of scales.</p>

<p>The next difficulty was to balance it, for
he had nothing but his lantern to hang on
the other end of the beam to balance the bell.
It was a prodigiously hard task to carry his
burden the six or seven miles distance to
Hiyeisan. It was "trying to balance a
bronze bell with a paper lantern."</p>

<p>The work made him puff and blow and
sweat until he was as hungry as a badger,
but he finally succeeded in hooking it up in
the belfry at Hiyeisan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>Then all the fellow priests of Benkei got
up, though at night, to welcome him. They
admired his bravery and strength and
wished to strike the bell at once to show
their joy.</p>

<p>"No, I won't lift a hammer or sound a
note till you make me some soup. I am
terribly hungry," said Benkei, as he sat down
on a cross piece of the belfry and wiped his
forehead with his cowl.</p>

<p>Then the priests got out the iron soup-pot,
five feet in diameter, and kindling a fire
made a huge mess of soup and served it to
Benkei. The lusty monk sipped bowl after
bowl of the steaming nourishment until the
pot was empty.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "you may sound the bell."</p>
</div>

<p>Five or six of the young bonzes mounted
the platform and seized the rope that held
the heavy log suspended from the roof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
The manner of striking the bell was to pull
back the log several feet, then let go the
rope, holding the log after the rebound.</p>

<p>At the first stroke the bell quivered and
rolled out a most mournful and solemn
sound which as it softened and died away
changed into the distinct murmur:</p>

<p>"I want to go back to Miidera, I want to
go back to Miidera, I want to go-o back to-o
M-i-i-de-ra-ra-a-a-a."</p>

<p>"Naru hodo" said the priests. "What a
strange bell. It wants to go back. It is not
satisfied with our ringing."</p>

<p>"Ah! I know what is the matter" said
the aged abbot. "It must be sprinkled
with holy water of Hiyeisan. Then it will
be happy with us. Ho! page bring hither
the deep sea shell full of sacred water."</p>

<p>So the pure white shell full of the consecrated
water was brought, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the holy man's brush. Dipping it in the
water the abbot sprinkled the bell inside
and out.</p>

<p>"I dedicate thee, oh bell, to Hiyeisan.
Now strike," said he, signalling to the bell-pullers.</p>

<p>Again the young men mounted the platform,
drew back the log with a lusty pull
and let fly.</p>

<p>"M-m-m-mi-mi-de-de-ra-ra ye-e-e-e-ko-o-o-o-o"
"(Miidera ye ko, I want to go back to
Miidera)" moaned out the homesick bell.</p>

<p>This so enraged Benkei that he rushed to
the rope waved the monks aside and seizing
the rope strained every muscle to jerk the
beam its entire length afield, and then let
fly with force enough to crack the bell. For
a moment the dense volume of sound filled
the ears of all like a storm, but as the vibrations
died away, the bell whined out:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>"Miidera-mi-mi-de-de-ra-a-a ye-e-e-ko-o-o-o-o."
"I want to go back to Miidera,"
sobbed the bell.</p>

<p>Whether struck at morning, noon or night
the bell said the same words. No matter
when, by whom, how hard or how gently it
was struck, the bell moaned the one plaint
as if crying, "I want to go back to Miidera."
"I want to go back to Miidera."</p>

<p>At last Benkei in a rage unhooked the
bell, shouldered it beam and all, and set off
to take it back. Carrying the bell to the
top of Hiyeisan, he set it down, and giving
it a kick rolled it down the valley toward
Miidera, and left it there. Then the Miidera
bonzes hung it up again. Since that time
the bell has completely changed its note,
until now it is just like other bells in sound
and behavior.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">K</span>O GIN SAN (Miss Little Silver)
was a young maid who did not
care for strange stories of animals,
so much as for those of
wonder-creatures in the form of human
beings. Even of these, however, she did not
like to dream, and when the foolish old
nurse would tell her ghost stories at night,
she was terribly afraid they would appear
to her in her sleep.</p>

<p>To avoid this, the old nurse told her to
draw pictures of a tapir, on the sheet of white
paper, which, wrapped round the tiny pillow,
makes the pillow-case of every young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
lady, who rests her head on two inches of a
bolster in order to keep her well-dressed
hair from being mussed or rumpled.</p>

<p>Old grannies and country folks believe
that if you have a picture of a tapir under
the bed or on the paper pillow-case, you
will not have unpleasant dreams, as the
tapir is said to eat them.</p>

<p>So strongly do some people believe this that
they sleep under quilts figured with the device
of this long-snouted beast. If in spite
of this precaution one should have a bad
dream, he must cry out on awaking, "tapir,
come eat, tapir, come eat"; when the tapir
will swallow the dream, and no evil results
will happen to the dreamer.</p>

<p>Little Silver listened with both eyes and
open mouth to this account of the tapir, and
then making the picture and wrapping it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
around her pillow, she fell asleep. I suspect
that the kowameshi (red rice) of which
she had eaten so heartily at supper time,
until her waist strings tightened, had something
to do with her travels in dream-land.</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>She thought she had gone down to Ozaka,
and there got on a junk and sailed far away
to the southwest, through the Inland sea.
One night the water seemed full of white
ghosts of men and women. Some of them
were walking on, and in, the water. Some
were running about. Here and there groups
appeared to be talking together. Once in a
while the junk would run against one of
them; and when Little Silver looked to see
if he were hurt or knocked over, she could
see nothing until the junk passed by, when
the ghost would appear standing in the same
place, as though the ship had gone through
empty air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>Occasionally a ghost would come up to the
side of the ship, and in a squeaky voice ask for
a dipper. While she would be wondering what
a ghost wanted to do with a dipper, a sailor
would quietly open a locker, take out a dipper
having no bottom, and give one every time he
was asked for them. Little Silver noticed
a large bundle of these dippers ready. The
ghosts would then begin to bail up water
out of the sea to empty it in the boat. All
night they followed the junk, holding on
with one hand to the gunwale, while they
vainly dipped up water with the other,
trying to swamp the boat. If dippers with
bottoms in them had been given them,
the sailors said, the boat would have been
sunk. When daylight appeared the shadowy
host of people vanished.</p>

<p>In the morning they passed an island, the
shores of which were high rocks of red coral.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>A great earthen jar stood on the beach, and
around it lay long-handled ladles holding a
half-gallon or more, and piles of very large
shallow red lacquered wine cups, which
seemed as big as the full moon. After the
sun had been risen some time, there came
down from over the hills a troop of the most
curious looking people. Many were short,
little wizen-faced folks, that looked very
old; or rather, they seemed old before they
ought to be. Some were very aged and
crooked, with hickory-nut faces, and hair of
a reddish gray tint. All the others had
long scarlet locks hanging loose over their
heads, and streaming down their backs.
Their faces were flushed as if by hard drinking,
and their pimpled noses resembled huge
red barnacles. No sooner did they arrive at
the great earthen jar than they ranged
themselves round it. The old ones dipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
out ladles full, and drank of the wine till
they reeled. The younger ones poured the
liquor into cups and drank. Even the little
infants guzzled quantities of the yellow sak&eacute;
from the shallow cups of very thin red-lacquered
wood.</p>

<p>Then began the dance, and wild and furious
it was. The leather-faced old sots
tossed their long reddish-grey locks in the
air, and pirouetted round the big sak&eacute; jar.
The younger ones of all ages clapped their
hands, knotted their handkerchiefs over
their foreheads, waved their dippers or cups
or fans, and practiced all kinds of antics,
while their scarlet hair streamed in the wind
or was blown in their eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>The dance over, they threw down their
cups and dippers, rested a few minutes and
then took another heavy drink all around.</p>

<p>"Now to work" shouted an old fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
whose face was redder than his half-bleached
hair, and who having only two teeth like
tusks left looked just like an <i>oni</i> (imp.) As
for his wife, her teeth had long ago fallen
out and the skin of her face seemed to have
added a pucker for every year since a half
century had rolled over her head.</p>

<p>Then Little Silver looked and saw them
scatter. Some gathered shells and burned
them to make lime. Others carried water
and made mortar, which they thickened by
a pulp made of paper, and a glue made by
boiling fish skin. Some dived under the
sea for red coral, which they hauled up by
means of straw ropes, in great sprigs as
thick as the branches of a tree. They
quickly ran up a scaffold, and while some of
the scarlet-headed plasterers smeared the
walls, others below passed up the tempered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
mortar on long shell shovels, to the hand
mortar-boards. Even at work they had
casks and cups of sak&eacute; at hand, while children
played in the empty kegs and licked
the gummy sugar left in some of them.</p>

<p>"What is that house for?" asked Little
Silver of the sailors.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the Kura (storehouse) in
which the King of the Sh&#333;ji stores the
treasures of life, and health, and happiness,
and property, which men throw away, or
exchange for the sak&eacute;, which he gives them,
by making funnels of themselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, Yes," said Little Silver to herself,
as she remembered how her father had said
of a certain neighbor who had lately been
drinking hard, "he swills sak&eacute; like a Sh&#333;ji."</p>

<p>She also understood why picnic or "chow-chow"
boxes were often decorated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
pictures of Sh&#333;ji, with their cups and dippers.
For, at these picnics, many men get
drunk; so much so indeed, that after a while
the master of the feast orders very poor and
cheap wine to be served to the guests. He
also replaces the delicate wine cups of egg-shell
porcelain, with big thick tea-cups or
wooden bowls, for the guests when drunk,
do not know the difference.</p>

<p>She also now understood why it was commonly
said of a Mr. Matsu, who had once
been very rich but was now a poor sot, "His
property has all gone to the Sh&#333;ji."</p>

<p>Just then the ship in which she was sailing
struck a rock, and the sudden jerk woke
up Little Silver, who cried out, "Tapir,
come eat; tapir, come eat."</p>

<p>No tapir came, but if he had I fear Little
Silver would have been more frightened than
she was by her dream of the ghosts; for
next morning she laughed to think how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
they had all their work a-dipping water
for nothing, and at her old nurse for thinking
a picture of a tapir could keep off
dreams.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>URIOUS CREATURES are the
tengus, with the head of a
hawk and the body of a man.
They have very hairy hands or
paws with two fingers, and feet
with two toes. They are hatched out of
eggs, and have wings and feathers, until
full grown. Then their wings moult, and
the stumps are concealed behind their dress,
which is like that of a man. They walk,
when grown up, on clogs a foot high, which
are like stilts, as they have but one support
instead of two, like the sort which men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
wear. The tengus strut about easily on
these, without stumbling.</p>

<p>The Dai Tengu, or master, is a solemn-faced,
scowling individual with a very proud
expression, and a nose about eight finger-breadths
long. When he goes abroad, his
retainers march before him, for fear he might
break his nose against something. He wears
a long grey beard down to his girdle, and
moustaches to his chin. In his left hand he
carries a large fan made of seven wide
feathers. This is the sign of his rank. He
has a mouth, but he rarely opens it. He is
very wise, and rules over all the tengus in
Japan.</p>

<p>The Karasu or crow-tengu is a black fellow,
with a long beak, in the place where
his nose and mouth ought to be. He looks
as if some one had squeezed out the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
part of his face, and pulled his nose down
so as to make a beak like a crow's. He is
the Dai Tengu's lictor. He carries the axe
of authority over his left shoulder, to chop
bad people's heads off. In his right fist
is his master's book of wisdom, and roll of
authority. Even these two highest in authority
in Tengu-land are servants of the
great lord Kampira, the long-haired patron
of sailors and mountaineers.</p>

<p>The greatest of the Dai Tengu lived in
Kurama mountain and taught Yoshitsun&eacute;.
This lad, while a pupil in the monastery,
would slip out in the evening, when the
priests thought him asleep, and come to the
King of the Tengus, who instructed him in
the military arts, in cunning, magic, and
wisdom. Every night the boy would
spread the roll of wisdom before him, and
sit at the feet of the hoary-headed tengu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and learn the strange letters in which tengu
wisdom is written, while the long-nosed
servant tengus, propped up on their stilt-clogs,
looked on. The boy was not afraid,
but quickly learned the knowledge which
birds, beasts and fishes have, how to understand
their language and to fly, swim and
leap like them.</p>

<p>When a tengu stumbles and falls down on
his nose, it takes a long while to heal, and if
he breaks it, the doctor puts it in splints
like a broken arm, until it straightens out
and heals up again.</p>

<p>Some of the amusements in Tengu-land
are very curious. A pair of young tengus
will fence with their noses as if they were
foils. Their faces are well protected by
masks, for if one tengu should "poke his
nose" into the other's eye he might put it
out, and a blind tengu could not walk about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
because he would be knocking his nose
against everything.</p>

<p>Two old tengus with noses nearly two
feet long, sometimes try the strength of
their face-handles. One fellow has his beak
straight up in the air like a supporting post,
while the other sits a yard off with his elastic
nose stretched across like a tight-rope,
and tied with twine at the top of the other
one's nose. On this tight nose-rope a little
tengu boy, with a tiny pug only two inches
long, dances a jig. He holds an umbrella
in his hand, now dancing, and now standing
upon one foot. The tengu-daddy, whose
nose serves as a tent-pole, waves his fan
and sings a song, keeping time to the dance.</p>

<p>There is another tengu who sometimes
quarrels with his wife, and when angry
boxes her ears with his nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
A lady-tengu who is inclined to be literary
and sentimental, writes poetry. When
the mood seizes her she ties the pen to her
nose, dips it in ink and writes a poem on
the wall.</p>

<p>A tengu-painter makes a long-handled
brush to whitewash the ceiling, by strapping
it to his nose.</p>

<p>Sometimes the little tengus get fighting,
and then the feathers fly as they tear each
other with their little claws which have
talons on them shaped like a chicken's, but
which when fully grown look like hands.</p>

<p>All the big tengus are fond of trying the
strength of their noses, and how far they
can bend them up and down without breaking.
They have two favorite games of
which they sometimes give exhibitions.
The player has long strings of iron cash
(that is, one hundred of the little iron coins,
with a square hole in the centre). Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of these he slides on a rope like buttons on
a string, or counters on a wire. Then he
lifts them off with the tip of his nose. Sometimes
his nose bends so much under the
weight that the coins slip off. Whichever
tengu can pick off the greater number of
strings without letting any slip, wins the
game, and is called O-hana (The King of
Noses).</p>
</div>

<p>Another balances hoops and poles on his
nose and throws balls through the hoops;
or he poises a saucer of water on the tip of
his nose without spilling a drop. Another
fellow hangs a bell from the ceiling. Then,
with a handkerchief tied loosely round his
head, he pulls his nose back like a snapping-turtle's
beak, and then suddenly lets
go. His nose then strikes the bell and rings
it. It hurts very much, but he does not
mind it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>The tengus have one great fault. They
love liquor too much. They often get
drunk. They buy great casks of rice-wine,
sling them round their necks, and drink out
of long cups shaped like their faces, using
the nose for a handle. A drunken tengu
makes a funny sight, as he staggers about
with his big wings drooping and flapping
around him, and the feathers trailing in the
mud, and his long nose limp, pendulous and
groggy.</p>

<p>When the master of the tengus wishes to
"see the flowers," which means to go on a
picnic, he punishes his drunken servant by
swinging the box of eatables over the fellow's
red nose. Putting the end over his
shoulders, he compels the sot to come along.
It sobers the fellow, for the weight on his
nose and the pulling on it hurts dreadfully,
and often makes him squeal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>Oyama, a mountain near Tokio, is said to
be full of these long-nosed elves, but many
other mountains are inhabited by them, for
they like lonely places away from men.</p>

<p>Dancers often put on masks like the tengu's
face and dance a curious dance which
they call the Tengu's quadrille.</p>

<p>The tengus are very proud fellows, and
think themselves above human beings.
They are afraid of brave men, however, and
never dare to hurt them. They scare children,
especially bad boys. They watch a
boy telling lies and catch him. Then the
tengus pull out his tongue by the roots, and
run away with it.</p>

<p>When a tengu walks, he folds his arms,
throws back his head till his nose is far up
in the air, and struts around as if he were a
daimio. When a man becomes vain and
carries his nose too high, the people say "He
has become a tengu."</p>

mountains were no higher than
a rice-stalk, there lived in that
part of the range called Ashigara,
a little ruddy boy, whom his mother
had named Kintar&#333;, or Golden Darling. He
was not like other boys, for having no children
to play with, he made companions of
the wild animals of the forest.</p>

<p>He romped with the little bears, and often
when the old she bear would come for her
cubs to give them their supper and put them
to bed, Kintar&#333; would jump on her back
and have a ride to her cave. He also put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
his arms around the neck of the deer, which
were not afraid of him. He was prince of
the forest, and the rabbits, wild boars, squirrels
and martens, pheasants and hawks were
his servants and messengers.</p>

<p>Although not much more than a fat baby,
Kintar&#333; wielded a big axe, and could chop
a snake to pieces before he had time to
wriggle.</p>

<p>Kintar&#333;'s father had been a brave soldier
in Ki&#333;to, who through the malice of enemies
at court, had fallen into disgrace. He
had loved a beautiful lady whom he married.
When her husband died she fled eastward
to the Ashigara mountains, and there in
the lonely forests in which no human being
except poor woodcutters ever came, her
boy was born.</p>

<p>She lived in a cave, nourishing herself on
roots and herbs. The woodcutters soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
learned about the strange pair living wild
but peacefully in the woods, though they
did not dream of her noble rank. The
boy was known among them as "Little
Wonder," and the woman as "The old nurse
of the mountain."</p>

<p>Thus, all alone, the little fellow grew up,
exercising himself daily, so that even though
a child he could easily wrestle with a bear.
Among his retainers were the tengus, though
they were often rebellious and disobedient,
not liking to be governed by a boy.</p>

<p>One day, an old mother-tengu, who had
always laughed at the idea of obeying a little
dumpling of a fellow like Kintar&#333;, flew
up to her nest in a high fir tree. Kintar&#333;
watched to see where it was, and waited till
she left it to go and seek for food. Then
going up to the tree, he shook it with all his
might, until the nest came tumbling down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and the two young squabs of tengus with it.</p>

<p>Now it happened that just at that time
the great hero and imp-killer, Raik&#333;,
was marching through the mountains on
his way to Ki&#333;to. Seeing that the ruddy
little fellow was no ordinary child, he found
out the mother and heard her story. He
then asked for the child and adopted him as
his own.</p>

<p>So Kintar&#333; went off with Raik&#333; and grew
up to be a brave soldier, and taking his
father's name, he was known as Sakata
Kintoki. His mother, however, remained
in the mountains, and living to an extreme
old age, was always known as "The old nurse
of the mountains."</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>To this day, Kintaro is the hero of
Japanese boys, and on their huge kites will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
usually be seen a picture of the little black-eyed
ruddy boy of the mountains, with his
axe, while around him are his wild playmates,
and the young tengus rubbing their
long noses, which were so nearly broken by
their fall.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>GATA was the name of a castle-lord
who lived in the Island of
the Nine Provinces, (Kiushiu).
He had but one son, an infant,
whom the people in admiration
nicknamed Jiraiya (Young Thunder.) During
one of the civil wars, this castle was
taken, and Ogata was slain; but by the aid
of a faithful retainer, who hid Jiraiya in his
bosom, the boy escaped and fled northward
to Echigo. There he lived until he grew up
to manhood.</p>

<p>At that time Echigo was infested with
robbers. One day the faithful retainer of
Jiraiya being attacked, made resistance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was slain by the robbers. Jiraiya now left
alone in the world went out from Echigo
and led a wandering life in several provinces.</p>

<p>All this time he was consumed with the
desire to revive the name of his father, and
restore the fortunes of his family. Being
exceedingly brave, and an expert swordsman,
he became chief of a band of robbers
and plundered many wealthy merchants,
and in a short time he was rich in men,
arms and booty. He was accustomed to
disguise himself, and go in person into the
houses and presence of men of wealth, and
thus learn all about their gates and guards,
where they slept, and in what rooms their
treasures were stored, so that success was
easy.</p>

<p>Hearing of an old man who lived in
Shinano, he started to rob him, and for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
purpose put on the disguise of a pilgrim.
Shinano is a very high table-land, full of
mountains, and the snow lies deep in winter.
A great snow storm coming on, Jiraiya
took refuge in a humble house by the way.
Entering, he found a very beautiful woman,
who treated him with great kindness. This,
however, did not change the robber's nature.
At midnight, when all was still, he unsheathed
his sword, and going noiselessly to her
room, he found the lady absorbed in reading.</p>

<p>Lifting his sword, he was about to strike
at her neck, when, in a flash, her body
changed into that of a very old man, who
seized the heavy steel blade and broke it in
pieces as though it were a stick. Then he
tossed the bits of steel away, and thus spoke
to Jiraiya, who stood amazed but fearless:</p>

<p>"I am a man named Senso Dojin, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
have lived in these mountains many hundred
years, though my true body is that of
a huge frog. I can easily put you to death
but I have another purpose. So I shall
pardon you and teach you magic instead."</p>

<p>Then the youth bowed his head to the
floor, poured out his thanks to the old man
and begged to be received as his pupil.</p>

<p>Remaining with the old man of the mountain
for several weeks, Jiraiya learned all
the arts of the mountain spirits; how to
cause a storm of wind and rain, to make a
deluge, and to control the elements at will.</p>

<p>He also learned how to govern the frogs,
and at his bidding they assumed gigantic
size, so that on their backs he could stand
up and cross rivers and carry enormous
loads.</p>

<p>When the old man had finished instructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
him he said "Henceforth cease from
robbing, or in any way injuring the poor.
Take from the wicked rich, and those who
acquire money dishonestly, but help the
needy and the suffering." Thus speaking,
the old man turned into a huge frog and
hopped away.</p>

<p>What this old mountain spirit bade him
do, was just what Jiraiya wished to accomplish.
He set out on his journey with a
light heart. "I can now make the storm and
the waters obey me, and all the frogs are at
my command; but alas! the magic of the
frog cannot control that of the serpent. I
shall beware of his poison."</p>

<p>From that time forth the oppressed poor
people rejoiced many a time as the avaricious
merchants and extortionate money
lenders lost their treasures. For when
a poor farmer, whose crops failed, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
not pay his rent or loan on the date
promised, these hard-hearted money lenders
would turn him out of his house, seize his
beds and mats and rice-tub, and even the
shrine and images on the god-shelf, to sell
them at auction for a trifle, to their minions,
who resold them at a high price for the
money-lender, who thus got a double benefit.
Whenever a miser was robbed, the people
said, "The young thunder has struck," and
then they were glad, knowing that it was
Jiraiya, (Young Thunder.) In this manner
his name soon grew to be the poor people's
watchword in those troublous times.</p>

<p>Yet Jiraiya was always ready to help the
innocent and honest, even if they were rich.
One day a merchant named Fukutaro was
sentenced to death, though he was really
not guilty. Jiraiya hearing of it, went to
the magistrate and said that he himself was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the very man who committed the robbery.
So the man's life was saved, and Jiraiya was
hanged on a large oak tree. But during
the night, his dead body changed into a bull-frog
which hopped away out of sight, and
off into the mountains of Shinano.</p>
</div>

<p>At this time, there was living in this
province, a young and beautiful maiden
named Tsunad&eacute;. Her character was very
lovely. She was always obedient to her
parents and kind to her friends. Her daily
task was to go to the mountains and cut
brushwood for fuel. One day while thus
busy singing at the task, she met a very old
man, with a long white beard sweeping his
breast, who said to her:</p>

<p>"Do not fear me. I have lived in this
mountain many hundred years, but my real
body is that of a snail. I will teach you
the powers of magic, so that you can walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
on the sea, or cross a river however swift
and deep, as though it were dry land."</p>

<p>Gladly the maiden took daily lessons of
the old man, and soon was able to walk on
the waters as on the mountain paths. One
day the old man said, "I shall now leave
you and resume my former shape. Use your
power to destroy wicked robbers. Help
those who defend the poor. I advise you
to marry the celebrated man Jiraiya, and
thus you will unite your powers."</p>

<p>Thus saying, the old man shrivelled up
into a snail and crawled away.</p>

<p>"I am glad," said the maiden to herself,
"for the magic of the snail can overcome
that of the serpent. When Jiraiya, who has
the magic of the frog, shall marry me, we
can then destroy the son of the serpent, the
robber named Dragon-coil (Orochimaru)."</p>

<p>By good fortune, Jiraiya met the maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Tsunad&eacute;, and being charmed with her
beauty, and knowing her power of magic,
sent a messenger with presents to her parents,
asking them to give him their daughter
to wife. The parents agreed, and so
the young and loving couple were married.</p>

<p>Hitherto when Jiraiya wished to cross a
river he changed himself into a frog and
swam across; or, he summoned a bull-frog
before him, which increased in size until as
large as an elephant. Then standing erect
on his warty back, even though the wind
blew his garments wildly, Jiraiya reached
the opposite shore in safety. But now, with
his wife's powers, the two, without any
delay, walked over as though the surface
was a hard floor.</p>

<p>Soon after their marriage, war broke out
in Japan between the two famous clans of
Tsukikag&eacute; and Inukag&eacute;. To help them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
fight their battles, and capture the castles of
their enemies, the Tsukikag&eacute; family besought
the aid of Jiraiya, who agreed to serve them
and carried their banner in his back. Their
enemies, the Inukag&eacute;, then secured the
services of Dragon-coil.</p>

<p>This Orochimaru, or Dragon-coil, was a
very wicked robber whose father was a man,
and whose mother was a serpent that lived
in the bottom of Lake Takura. He was
perfectly skilled in the magic of the serpent,
and by spurting venom on his enemies,
could destroy the strongest warriors.</p>

<p>Collecting thousands of followers, he made
great ravages in all parts of Japan, robbing
and murdering good and bad, rich and poor
alike. Loving war and destruction he joined
his forces with the Inukag&eacute; family.</p>

<p>Now that the magic of the frog and snail
was joined to the one army, and the magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of the serpent aided the other, the conflicts
were bloody and terrible, and many men
were slain on both sides.</p>

<p>On one occasion, after a hard fought battle,
Jiraiya fled and took refuge in a monastery,
with a few trusty vassals, to rest a short
time. In this retreat a lovely princess
named Tagoto was dwelling. She had fled
from Orochimaru, who wished her for his
bride. She hated to marry the offspring of
a serpent, and hoped to escape him. She
lived in fear of him continually. Orochimaru
hearing at one time that both Jiraiya
and the princess were at this place, changed
himself into a serpent, and distilling a large
mouthful of poisonous venom, crawled up to
the ceiling in the room where Jiraiya and
his wife were sleeping, and reaching a spot
directly over them, poured the poisonous
venom on the heads of his rivals. The fumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the prison so stupefied Jiraiya's followers,
and even the monks, that Orochimaru, instantly
changing himself to a man, profited
by the opportunity to seize the princess
Tagoto, and make off with her.</p>

<p>Gradually the faithful retainers awoke
from their stupor to find their master and
his beloved wife delirious, and near the
point of death, and the princess gone.</p>

<p>"What can we do to restore our dear
master to life?" This was the question each
one asked of the others, as with sorrowful
faces and weeping eyes they gazed at the
pallid forms of their unconscious master and
his consort. They called in the venerable
abbot of the monastery to see if he could
suggest what could be done.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the aged priest, "there is no
medicine in Japan to cure your lord's disease,
but in India there is an elixir which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
is a sure antidote. If we could get that, the
master would recover."</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" and a chorus of groans
showed that all hope had fled, for the mountain
in India, where the elixir was made,
lay five thousand miles from Japan.</p>

<p>Just then a youth named Rikimatsu, one
of the pages of Jiraiya, arose to speak. He
was but fourteen years old, and served
Jiraiya out of gratitude, for he had rescued
his father from many dangers and saved his
life. He begged permission to say a word
to the abbot, who, seeing the lad's eager
face, motioned to him with his fan to speak.</p>

<p>"How long can our lord live," asked the
youth.</p>

<p>"He will be dead in thirty hours," answered
the abbot, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I'll go and procure the medicine, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
our master is still living when I come back,
he will get well."</p>

<p>Now Rikimatsu had learned magic and
sorcery from the Tengus, or long-nosed
elves of the mountains, and could fly high
in the air with incredible swiftness. Speaking
a few words of incantation, he put on
the wings of a Tengu, mounted a white
cloud and rode on the east wind to India,
bought the elixir of the mountain spirits,
and returned to Japan in one day and a
night.</p>

<p>On the first touch of the elixir on the
sick man's face he drew a deep breath,
perspiration glistened on his forehead, and
in a few moments more he sat up.</p>

<p>Jiraiya and his wife both got well, and
the war broke out again. In a great battle
Dragon-coil was killed and the princess
rescued. For his prowess and aid Jiraiya
was made daimio of Idzu.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>Being now weary of war and the hardships
of active life, Jiraiya was glad to settle
down to tranquil life in the castle and rear
his family in peace. He spent the remainder
of his days in reading the books of the
sages, in composing verses, in admiring the
flowers, the moon and the landscape, and
occasionally going out hawking or fishing.
There, amid his children and children's
children, he finished his days in peace.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ARTS of the seas of the Japanese
Archipelago are speckled with
thousands of round white jelly-fish,
that swim a few feet below
the surface. One can see the
great steamer go ploughing through them as
through a field of frosted cakes. The huge
paddle-wheels make a perfect pudding of
thousands of them, as they are dashed
against the paddle-box and whipped into a
froth like white of eggs or churned into a
thick cream by the propeller blades. Sometimes
the shoals are of great breadth, and
then it veritably looks as though a crockery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
shop had been upset in the ocean, and ten
thousand white dinner-plates had broken
loose. Around the bays and harbors the
Japanese boys at play drive them with paddles
into shoals, and sometimes they poke
sticks through them. This they can do
easily, because the jelly-fish has no jacket
of shell or bone like the lobster, nor any
skin like a fish, and so always has to swim
naked, exposed to all kinds of danger. Sometimes
great jelly-fishes, two or three feet in
diameter, sail gaily along near the shore, as
proud as the long-handled-umbrella of a
daimi&#333;, and as brilliantly colored as a Japanese
parasol. Floating all around their
bodies, like the streamers of a temple festival,
or a court lady's ribbons, are their long
tentacles or feelers. No peacock stretching
his bannered tail could make a finer sight,
or look prouder than these floating sun-fishes,
or bladders of living jelly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>But alas for all things made of water!
Let but a wave of unusual force, or a sudden
gust of wind come, and this lump of pride
lies collapsed and stranded on the shore,
like a pancake upset into a turnover, in
which batter and crust are hopelessly mixed
together. When found fresh, men often
come down to the shore and cutting huge
slices of blubber, as transparent as ice, they
eat the solid water with their rice, in lieu of
drink.</p>

<p>A jelly-fish as big as an umbrella, and
weighing as much as a big boy, will, after
lying a few hours in the sun leave scarcely
a trace on the spot for their bodies are little
more than animated masses of water.
At night, however where a jelly-fish has
stranded, the ground seems to crawl and
emit a dull fire of phosphorescence which
the Japanese call "dragon's light."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>But the jelly-fish once had a shell, and
was not so defenceless, say the fairy tales.
How it lost it is thus told.</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>In the days of old, the jelly-fish was one
of the retainers in waiting upon the Queen
of the World under the Sea, at her palace
in Riu Gu. In those days he had a shell,
and as his head was hard, no one dared to
insult him, or stick him with their horns,
or pinch him with their claws, or scratch
him with their nails, or brush rudely by
him with their fins. In short, this fish instead
of being a lump of jelly, as white and
helpless as a pudding, as we see him now,
was a lordly fellow that could get his back
up and keep it high when he wished to. He
waited on the queen and right proud was he
of his office. He was on good terms with
the King's dragon, which often allowed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to play with his scaly tail but never hurt
him in the least.</p>

<p>One day the Queen fell sick, and every
hour grew worse. The King became anxious,
and her subjects talked about nothing
else but her sickness. There was grief all
through the water-world; from the mermaids
on their beds of sponge, and the
dragons in the rocky caverns, down to the
tiny gudgeons in the rivers, that were considered
no more than mere bait. The jolly
cuttle-fish stopped playing his drums and
guitar, folded his six arms and hid away
moping in his hole. His servant the lobster
in vain lighted his candle at night, and tried
to induce him to come out of his lair. The
dolphins and porpoises wept tears, but the
clams, oysters and limpets shut up their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
shells and did not even wiggle. The flounders
and skates lay flat on the ocean's floor,
never even lifting up their noses. The
squid wept a great deal of ink, and the jelly-fish
nearly melted to pure water. The tortoise
was patient and offered to do anything
for the relief of the Queen.</p>

<p>But nothing could be done. The cuttle-fish
who professed to be "a kind of a" doctor,
offered the use of all his cups to suck out
the poison, if that were the trouble.</p>

<p>But it wasn't. It was internal, and nothing
but medicine that could be swallowed
would reach the disease.</p>

<p>At last some one suggested that the liver
of a monkey would be a specific for the
royal sickness, and it was resolved to try it.
The tortoise, who was the Queen's messenger,
because he could live on both land and water,
swim or crawl, was summoned. He was
told to go upon earth to a certain mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
catch a monkey and bring him alive to the
Under-world.</p>

<p>Off started the tortoise on his journey to
the earth, and going to a mountain where
the monkeys lived, squatted down at the
foot of a tree and pretended to be asleep
though keeping his claws and tail out.
There he waited patiently, well knowing
that curiosity and the monkey's love of
tricks would bring one within reach of his
talons. Pretty soon, a family of chattering
monkeys came running along among the
branches overhead, when suddenly a young
<i>saru</i> (monkey) caught sight of the sleeping
tortoise.</p>

<p>"<i>Naru hodo</i>" (Is it possible?) said the
long-handed fellow, "here's fun; let's tickle
the old fellow's back and pull his tail."</p>

<p>All agreed, and forthwith a dozen monkeys,
joining hand over hand, made a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
ladder of themselves until they just reached
the tortoise's back. (They didn't use their
tails, for Japanese monkeys have none, except
stumps two inches long). However, he
who was to be the tail end of this living
rope, when all was ready, crawled along and
slipped over the whole line, whispering as
he slid:</p>

<p>"'Sh! don't chatter or laugh, you'll wake
the old fellow up."</p>
</div>

<p>Now the monkey expected to hold on the
living pendulum by one long hand, and
swinging down with the other, to pull the
tortoise's tail, and see how near he could
come to his snout without being snapped
up. For a monkey well knew that a tortoise
could neither jump off its legs nor
climb a tree.</p>

<p>Once! Twice! The monkey pendulum
swung back and forth without touching.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>Three! Four! The monkey's finger-nails
scratched the tortoise's back. Yet old
Hard Shell pretended to be sound asleep.</p>

<p>Five! Six! The monkey caught hold
of the tortoise's tail and jerked it hard. Old
Tortoise now moved out its head a little, as
if still only half awake.</p>

<p>Seven! Eight! This time the monkey
intended to pull the tortoise's head, when
just as he came within reach, the tortoise
snapped him, held him in his claws, and as
the monkey pendulum swung back he lost
his hold. In an instant he was jerked loose,
and fell head-foremost to the ground, half
stunned.</p>

<p>Frightened at the loss of their end link,
the other monkeys of the chain wound themselves
up like a windlass over the branches,
and squatting on the trees, set up a doleful
chattering.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now," says the tortoise, "I want you
to go with me. If you don't, I'll eat you up.
Get on my back and I'll carry you; but I
must hold your paw in my mouth so you
won't run away."</p>

<p>Half frightened to death, the monkey
obeyed, and the tortoise trotted off to the
sea, swam to the spot over the Queen's
palace, and in a fillip of the finger was down
in the gardens of Riu Gu.</p>

<p>Here, let me say, that according to
another version of this story the monkeys
assembled in force when they suspected
what the tortoise had come after, and catching
him napping turned him over on his
back so that he could not move or bite.
Then they took his under shell off, so that
he had to travel back to Riu Gu and get
another one. This last version however is
uncertain and it looks like a piece of invention<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to suppose that the monkeys had a
sufficient medical knowledge to make them
suspicious of the design of the tortoise on
the monkey's liver. I prefer the regular
account.

<p>The Queen hearing of the monkey's arrival
thanked the tortoise, and commanded
her cook and baker to feed him well and
treat him kindly, for the queen felt really
sorry because he was to lose his liver.</p>

<p>As for the monkey he enjoyed himself
very much, and ran around everywhere
amusing the star-fishes, clams, oysters and
other pulpy creatures that could not run,
by his rapid climbing of the rocks and coral
bushes, and by rolling over the sponge beds
and cutting all manner of antics.</p>

<p>They had never before seen anything like
it. Poor fellow! he didn't suspect what
was to come.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>All this time however the jelly-fish pitied
him in his heart, and could hardly keep
what he knew to himself. Seeing that the
monkey, lonely and homesick was standing
by the shore of a pond, the jelly-fish squeezed
himself up near him and said:</p>

<p>"Excuse my addressing you, I feel very
sorry for you because you are to be put to
death."</p>

<p>"Why?" said the monkey, "What have
I done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said the jelly-fish, "only
our queen is sick and she wants your liver
for medicine."</p>

<p>Then if ever any one saw a sick looking
monkey it was this one. As the Japanese
say "his liver was smashed." He felt dreadfully
afraid. He put his hands over his
eyes, and immediately began to plan how to
save both his liver and his life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>After a while the rain began to fall
heavily, and the monkey ran in out of
the garden, and standing in the hall of the
Queen's palace began to weep bitterly. Just
then the tortoise, passing by, saw his captive.</p>

<p>"What are you crying about?"</p>

<p>"Aita! aita!" cried the monkey, "When
I left my home on the earth, I forgot to
bring my liver with me, but hung it upon a
tree, and now it is raining and my liver will
decay and I'll die. Aita! aita!" and the
poor monkey's eyes became red as a <i>tai</i> fish,
and streamed with tears.</p>

<p>When the tortoise told the Queen's courtiers
what the monkey had said, their faces
fell.</p>

<p>"Why, here's a pretty piece of business.
The monkey is of no use without his liver.
We must send him after it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>So they dispatched the tortoise to the
earth again, the monkey sitting a-straddle
of his back. They came to the mountain
again, and the tortoise being a little lazy,
waited at the foot while the monkey scampered
off, saying he would be back in an
hour. The two creatures had become so
well acquainted that the old Hard Shell fully
trusted the lively little fellow.</p>

<p>But instead of an hour the tortoise
waited till evening. No monkey came. So
finding himself fooled, and knowing all the
monkeys would take the alarm, he waddled
back and told the Queen all about it.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Queen after reprimanding
her messenger for his silly confidence,
"the monkey must have got wind of our intention
to use his liver, and what is more,
some one of my retainers or servants must
have told him."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>Then the Queen issued an order commanding
all her subjects to appear before
the Dragon-King of the Sea. Whoever did
this wicked thing, Kai Riu O would punish
him.</p>

<p>Now it happened that all the fish and
sea animals of all sorts, that swam, crawled,
rolled or moved in any way, appeared before
Kai Riu O, the Dragon-King, and his
Queen&mdash;all except the jelly-fish. Then the
Queen knew the jelly-fish was the guilty
one. She ordered the culprit to be brought
into her presence. Then publicly, before
all her retainers and servants, she cried out:</p>

<p>"You leaky-tongued wretch, for your
crime of betraying the confidence of your
sovereign, you shall no longer remain among
shell-fish. I condemn you to lose your
shell."</p>

<p>Then she stripped off his shell, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the poor jelly-fish entirely naked and
ashamed.</p>

<p>"Be off, you tell-tale. Hereafter all your
children shall be soft and defenceless."</p>

<p>The poor jelly-fish blushed crimson,
squeezed himself out, and swam off out of
sight. Since that time jelly-fishes have had
no shells.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ESPITE the loss of the monkey's
liver, the queen of the World under
the Sea, after careful attention
and long rest, got well again,
and was able to be about her
duties and govern her kingdom well. The
news of her recovery created the wildest
joy all over the Under-world, and from tears
and gloom and silence, the caves echoed
with laughter, and the sponge-beds with
music. Every one had on a "white face."
Drums, flutes and banjos, which had been
hung up on coral branches, or packed away
in shell boxes, were taken down, or brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
out, and right merrily were they struck or
thrummed with the ivory <i>hashi</i> (plectrum).
The pretty maids of the Queen put on their
ivory thimble-nails, and the Queen again
listened to the sweet melodies on the <i>koto</i>,
(flat harp), while down among the smaller
fry of fishy retainers and the scullions of
the kitchen, were heard the constant thump
of the <i>tsutsumi</i> (shoulder-drum), the bang
of the taiko (big drum), and the loud cries
of the dancers as they struck all sorts of
attitudes with hands, feet and head.</p>

<p>No allusion was openly made either to
monkeys, tortoises or jelly-fish. This would
not have been polite. But the jelly-fish, in
a distant pool in the garden, could hear the
refrain, "The rivers of China run into the
sea, and in it sinks the rain."</p>

<p>Now in the language of the Under-world
people the words for "river," and "skin,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
(or "covering,") and "China," and "shell,"
and "rain," and "jelly," are the same. So
the chorus, which was nothing but a string
of puns, meant, "The skin of the jelly-fish
runs to the sea, and in it sinks the jelly."</p>

<p>But none of these musical performances
were worthy of the Queen's notice; although
as evidences of the joy of her subjects, they
did very well. A great many entertainments
were gotten up to amuse the finny
people, but the Queen was present at none
of them except the one about to be described.
How and why she became a spectator shall
also be told.</p>

<p>One night the queen was sitting in the
pink drawing-room, arrayed in her queenly
robes, for she was quite recovered and expected
to walk out in the evening. Everything
in the room, except a vase of green
and golden colored sponge-plant, and a plume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of glass-thread, was of a pink color. Then
there was a pretty rockery made of a pyramid
of pumice, full of embossed rosettes of
living sea-anemones of scarlet, orange, grey
and black colors, which were trained to fold
themselves up like an umbrella, or blossom
out like chrysanthemums, at certain hours of
the day, or when touched, behaving just
like four o'clocks and sensitive plants.</p>

<p>All the furniture and hangings of the
rooms were pink. The floor was made of
mats woven from strips of shell-nacre, bound
at the sides with an inch border of pink
coral. The ceiling was made of the rarest
of pink shells wrought into flowers and
squares. The walls were decorated with the
same material, representing sea-scenes, jewels
and tortoise shell patterns. In the <i>tokonoma</i>,
or raised space, was a bouquet of sea-weed
of richest dyes, and in the nooks was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
open cabinet holding several of the queen's
own treasures, such as a tiara which looked
like woven threads of crystal (Euplectella),
and a toilet box and writing case made of
solid pink coral. The gem of all was a
screen having eight folds, on which was
depicted the palace and throne-room of Riu
Gu, the visit of Toda, and the procession of
the Queen, nobles and grandees that escorted
the brave archer, when he took his farewell
to return to earth.</p>

<p>The Queen sat on the glistening sill of the
wide window looking out over her gardens,
her two maids sitting at her feet. The
sound of music wafted through the coral
groves and crystal grottoes reached her ear.</p>

<p>"<i>O medzurashi gozarimasu!</i>" "(How
wonderful this is!)" exclaimed the queen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>half aloud. "What strange music is this?
It is neither guitar, nor hand, nor shoulder
drum, nor singing. It seems to be a mixture
of all. Hear! It sounds as if a band with
many instruments was playing to the accompaniment
of a large choir of voices."</p>

<p>True enough! It was the most curious
music ever heard in Riu Gu, for to tell the
truth the voices were not in perfect accord,
though all kept good time. The sound
seemed to issue from the mansion of Lord
Cuttle-fish, the palace physician. The queen's
curiosity was roused.</p>

<p>"I shall go and see what it is," said she, as
she rose up. Suddenly she recollected, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O, no, it would not be proper for me to
be seen in public at this hour of the evening,
and if it is in Lord Cuttle-fish's mansion,
I could not enter without a retinue, No, it
won't do for me, it's beneath my dignity,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
said her majesty to herself as she went over
to touch her anemones, while her maids
fanned her, seeing their mistress flushed
with excitement, and fearing a relapse.</p>

<p>Curiosity got the better of the queenly
lady, and off she started with only her two
maids who held aloft over her head, the
long pearl-handled fans made of white
shark's fins.</p>

<p>"Besides," thought she, "perhaps the concert
is outside, in the garden. If so, I can
look down and see from the great green
rock that overlooks it, and my lord Kai Riu
O need not know of it."</p>
</div>

<p>The Queen walked over her pebbled
garden walk, avoiding the great high road
paved with white coral rock, and taking a
by-path trimmed with fan-coral. The sound
of the drums and voices grew louder, until
as she reached the top of a green rock back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of Lord Cuttle-fish's garden, the whole performance
was open to her view.</p>

<p>It was so funny, and the queen was so
overcome at the comical sight, that she
nearly fell down and got the hysterics,
laughing so heartily. She utterly forgot
her dignity, and laughed till the tears ran
down her face. She was so afraid she would
scream out, that she nearly choked herself
to death with her sleeve, while her alarmed
maids, though meaning nothing by their
acts but friendly help, slapped her back to
give her breath.</p>

<p>There, at the top of a high green rock, all
covered with barnacles, on a huge tuft of
sponge, sat Lord Cuttle-fish, playing on
three musical instruments at once. His
great warty speckled head, six feet high,
like a huge bag upside down, was bent forward
to read the notes of his music book by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the light of a wax candle, which was stuck
in the feelers of a prickly lobster, and
patiently held. Of his six pulpy arms one
long one ran down like the trunk of an
elephant, fingering along the pages of a
music book. Two others were used to play
the guitar, one to grasp the handle and
pinch the strings, and the other to hold the
ivory stick to strike the strings. The tsutsumi
(small double drum) was held on his
shoulder and neck, while still another arm
curled up in a bunch, punched it like a fist.
Below him was a another, a bass drum, set
in a frame, and in his last leg, or arm, was
clutched a heavy drum-stick, which pounded
out tremendous noise, if not music. There
the old fellow sat with his head bobbing,
and all his six cuppy arms in motion, his
rolling blue eyes ogling the notes, and his
mouth like an elephant's, screeching out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
song, which was made up of puns on 'tortoises,'
'monkeys,' 'jelly-fishes,' 'livers'
and 'shell,' though the real words made an
entirely different sense.</p>

<p>All this time, in front of Lord Cuttle-fish,
sat the lobster holding up the light, like the
<i>kurombo</i>, or black fellows who hold candles
at the end of long-handled candle-sticks on
the stage of the theatres so that the people
may see the faces of the actors.</p>

<p>But the audience, or rather the orchestra
was the funniest part of all. They could
hardly be called listeners, for they were all
performers. On the left was the lusty red-faced
<i>tai</i> fish with its gills wide open, singing
at the top, or rather at the bottom, of
his throat, and beating time by flapping his
wide fins. Just back of him was a little
gudgeon, silent and fanning himself with a
blue flat fan, having disgracefully broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
down on a high note. Next behind, on the
right, was a long-nosed gar-fish singing alto,
and proud of her slender form, with the last
new thing in folding fans held in her fin.
In the fore-ground squatted a great fat frog
with big bulging eyes, singing base, and
leading the choir by flapping his webbed
fingers up and down with his frightful cavern
of a mouth wide open. Next, sat the stately
and dignified mackerel who was rather
scandalized at the whole affair, and kept
very still, refusing to join in. At the mackerel's
right fin, squeaked out the stupid flat-headed
<i>fugu</i> fish with her big eye impolitely
winking at the servant-maid just bringing
in refreshments; for the truth was, she was
thirsty after so much vocal exercise. The
<i>fugu</i> was very vain and always played the
coquette around the hooks of the fishermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
who always liked to eat her because she was
so sweet, yet her flesh was poison.</p>

<p>"How strange it is that men will angle
after that ugly hussy, when she poisons
them," was the oft-repeated remark of the
gar-fish.</p>

<p>Just behind the herring, with one eye on
Lord Cuttle-fish and one on the coming
refreshments, was the skate. The truth
must be told that the entire right wing of the
orchestra was very much demoralized by the
smell of the steaming tea and eatables just
about to be served. The suppon, (tortoise
with a snout like a bird's beak,) though he
continued to sing, impolitely turned his
head away from Lord Cuttle-fish, and his
back to the frog that acted as precentor.
The sucker, though very homely, and bloated
with fat, kept on in the chorus, and pretended
not to notice the waiter and her tray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and cups. Indeed, Madame Sucker thought
it quite vulgar in the tortoise to be so eager
after the cakes and wine.</p>

<p>In truth the concert had been long, and
all were thirsty and ready for a bite and a
drink.</p>

<p>Suddenly the music ceased, and the long
clatter on the drum announced the end.
Lord Cuttle-fish kicked over his drum, unscrewed
his guitar, and packed it away in
his music box. He then slid along on his
six slippery legs to the refreshments, and
actually amused the company by standing
on his head, and twirling his six cuppy arms
around.</p>

<p>At this Miss Mackerel was quite shocked,
and whispered under her fan to the gar-fish,
"It is quite undignified. What would
the Queen say if she saw it?" not knowing
that the Queen was looking on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>Then all sat down on their tails, propped
upright on one fin, and produced their fans
to cool themselves off. The lobster pulled
off the candle stump and ate it up, wiped
his feelers, and joined the party.</p>

<p>The liquid refreshments consisted of sweet
and clear <i>sak&eacute;</i> (rice beer) tea, and cherry-blossom
water. The solids were thunder-cakes,
egg-cracknels, boiled rice, <i>daikon</i>
radishes and macaroni, lotus-root, <i>taro</i>,
and side-dishes piled up with flies, worms,
bugs and all kinds of bait for the small fry&mdash;the
finny brats that were to eat at the
second table. The tea was poured by the
servants of Lord Cuttle-fish. These were
the funniest little green <i>kappas</i>, or creatures
half way between a monkey and a tortoise,
with yellow eyes, hands like an ape, hair
clipped short on their heads, eyes like frogs,
and a mouth that stretched from ear to ear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>Poor creatures! they were only too happy
to know that though they looked like
monkeys their livers would not do for medicine.</p>

<p>The Queen did not wait to see the end of
the feast, but laughing heartily, returned to
her palace and went to sleep.</p>

<p>After helping himself with all the cups of
his arms out of the tub of boiled rice, until
Miss Mackerel made up her mind that he
was an <i>omeshi gurai</i>, (rice glutton,) and
drinking like a shoal of fishes, Lord Cuttle-fish
went home, coiled himself up into a
ball, and fell asleep. He had a headache
next morning.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>ENZAN YORIMASA was a brave
warrior and a very useful man
who lived more than eight thousand
moons ago. On account
of his valor and skill in the use
of the bow he was called to Kioto, and promoted
to be chief guard of the imperial
palace. At that time the emperor, Narahito,
could not sleep at night, because his rest
was disturbed by a frightful beast, which
scared away even the sentinels in armor
who stood on guard.</p>

<p>This dreadful beast had the wings of a
bird, the body and claws of a tiger, the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of a monkey, a serpent tail, and the crackling
scales of a dragon. It came after night,
upon the roof of the palace, and howled
and scratched so dreadfully, that the poor
mikado losing all rest, grew weak and thin.
None of the guards dare face it in hand-to-hand
fight, and none had skill enough to hit
it with an arrow in the dark, though several
of the imperial corps of archers had tried
again and again. When Yorimasa received
his appointment, he strung his bow carefully,
and carefully honing his steel-headed arrows,
stored his quiver, and resolved to mount
guard that night with his favorite retainer.</p>

<p>It chanced to be a stormy night. The
lightning was very vivid, and Kaminari,
the thunder-god was beating all his drums.
The wind swirled round frightfully, as
though Fuden the wind-god was emptying
all his bags. Toward midnight, the falcon
eye of Yorimasa saw, during a flash of lightning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the awful beast sitting on the "devil's
tile" at the tip of the ridge-pole, on the
north-east end of the roof. He bade his
retainer have a torch of straw and twigs
ready to light at a moment's notice, to loosen
his blade, and wet its hilt-pin, while he
fitted the notch of his best arrow into the
silk cord of his bow.</p>

<p>Keeping his eyes strained, he pretty soon
saw the glare now of one eye, now two eyes,
as the beast with swaying head crept along
the great roof to the place on the eaves
directly under the mikado's sleeping-room.
There it stopped.</p>

<p>This was Yorimasa's opportunity. Aiming
about a foot to the right of where he saw
the eye glare, he drew his yard-length shaft
clear back to his shoulder, and let fly. A
dull thud, a frightful howl, a heavy bump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
on the ground, and the writhing of some
creature among the pebbles, told in a few
seconds time that the shaft had struck flesh.
The next instant Yorimasa's retainer rushed
out with blazing torch and joined battle
with his dirk. Seizing the beast by the
neck, he quickly despatched him, by cutting
his throat. Then they flayed the monster,
and the next morning the hide was shown
to his majesty.</p>

<p>All congratulated Yorimasa on his valor
and marksmanship. Many young men, sons
of nobles and warriors, begged to become
his pupils in archery. The mikado ordered
a noble of very high rank to present to
Yorimasa a famous sword named Shishi-no-&#333;,
(King of Wild Boars), and to give him a
lovely maid of honor named Ayami, to wife.
And so the brave and the fair were married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and to this day the fame of Yorimasa is like
the "um&eacute;-tak&eacute;-matsu," (plum-blossom, bamboo
and pine), fragrant, green and ever-during.

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the capital of Japan was
the city of Kioto, and the
mikado dwelt in it with all his
court, there lived a brave captain
of the guard named Yorimitsu,
who belonged to the famous Minamoto
family. He was also called Raiko,
and by this name he is best known to all
the boys and girls in Great Japan. Under
Captain Raiko were three brave guardsmen,
one of whom was named Watanab&eacute; Tsuna.
The duty of these men-at-arms was to watch
at the gates leading to the palace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>It had come to pass that the blossom
capital had fallen in a dreadful condition,
because the guards at the other gates had
been neglected. Thieves were numerous
and murders were frequent, so that every
one in the city was afraid to go out into the
streets at night. Worse than all else, was
the report that oni or imps were prowling
around in the dark to seize people by the
hair of the head. Then they would drag
them away to the mountains, tear the flesh
off their bones, and eat them up.</p>

<p>The worst place in the city, to which the
horned imps came oftenest, was at the
south-western gate called the Rajo-mon.</p>

<p>To this post of danger, Raiko sent Tsuna,
the bravest of his guards.</p>

<p>It was on a dark, rainy and dismal night,
that Tsuna started, well-armed, to stand
sentinel at the gate. His trusty helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
was knotted over his chin, and all the pieces
of his armor were well laced up. His
sandals were girt tight to his feet, and in
his belt was thrust the trusty sword, freshly
ground, until its edge was like a razor's, and
with it the owner could cut asunder a hair
floating in the air.</p>

<p>Arriving at the red pillar of the gate,
Tsuna paced up and down the stone way
with eyes and ears wide open. The wind
was blowing frightfully, the storm howled
and the rain fell in such torrents that soon
the cords of Tsuna's armor and his dress
were soaked through.</p>

<p>The great bronze bell of the temples on
the hills boomed out the hours one after
another, until a single stroke told Tsuna it
was the hour of the Rat (midnight).</p>

<p>Two hours passed, and the hour of the
Bull sounded (2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,) still Tsuna was wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
awake. The storm had lulled, but it was
darker than ever.</p>

<p>The hour of the Tiger (3 o'clock) rung
out, and the soft mellow notes of the temple
bell died away like a lullaby wooing one to
sleep, spite of will and vow.</p>

<p>The warrior, almost without knowing it,
grew sleepy and fell into a doze. He started
and woke up. He shook himself, jingled
his armor, pinched himself, and even pulled
out his little knife from the wooden scabbard
of his dirk, and pricked his leg with
the point of it to keep awake, but all in vain.
Unconsciously overcome, he leaned against
the gate-post, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>This was just what the imp wanted. All
the time he had been squatting on the cross-piece
at the top of the gate waiting his
opportunity. He now slid down as softly
as a monkey, and with his iron-like claws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
grabbed Tsuna by the helmet, and began to
drag him into the air.</p>

<p>In an instant Tsuna was awake. Seizing
the hairy wrist of the imp with his left
hand, with his right he drew his sword,
swept it round his head, and cut off the
demon's arm. The oni, frightened and howling
with pain, leaped up the post and disappeared
in the clouds.</p>

<p>Tsuna waited with drawn sword in hand,
lest the oni might come again, but in a few
hours morning dawned. The sun rose on
the pagodas and gardens and temples of the
capitol and the nine-fold circle of flowery
hills. Everything was beautiful and bright.
Tsuna returned to report to his captain,
carrying the oni's arm in triumph. Raiko
examined it, and loudly praised Tsuna for
his bravery, and rewarded him with a silken
sash.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>Now it is said that if an oni's arm be cut
off it cannot be made to unite with the body
again, if kept apart for a week. So Raiko
warned Tsuna to lock it up, and watch it
night and day, lest it be stolen from him.</p>

<p>So Tsuna went to the stone-cutters who
made idols of Buddha, mortars for pounding
rice, and coffers for burying money in to be
hidden away in the ground, and bought a
strong box cut out of the solid stone. It
had a heavy lid on it, which slid in a groove
and came out only by touching a secret
spring. Then setting it in his bed chamber,
he guarded it day and night, keeping
the gate and all his doors locked. He
allowed no one who was a stranger to look
at the trophy.</p>
</div>

<p>Six days passed by, and Tsuna began to
think his prize was sure, for were not all
his doors tight shut? So he set the box out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
in the middle of the room, and twisting some
rice-straw fringe in token of sure victory
and rejoicing, he sat down in ease before it.
He took off his armor and put on his court
robes. During the evening, but rather late,
there was a feeble knock like that of an old
woman at the gate outside.</p>

<p>Tsuna cried out, "Who's there?"</p>

<p>The squeaky voice of his aunt (as it seemed),
who was a very old woman, replied "Me,
I want to see my nephew, to praise him for
his bravery in cutting the oni's arm off."</p>

<p>So Tsuna let her in and carefully locking
the door behind her, helped the old crone
into the room, where she sat down on the
mats in front of the box and very close to
it. Then she grew very talkative, and
praised her nephew's exploit, until Tsuna
felt very proud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
All the time the old woman's left shoulder
was covered with her dress while her
right hand was out. Then she begged
earnestly to be allowed to see the limb.
Tsuna at first politely refused, but she
urged, until yielding affectionately he slid
back the stone lid just a little.</p>

<p>"This is my arm" cried the old hag, turning
into an oni, and dragging out the arm.</p>

<p>She flew up to the ceiling, and was out of
the smoke-slide through the roof in a twinkling.
Tsuna rushed out of the house to
shoot her with an arrow, but he saw only a
demon far off in the clouds grinning horribly.
He noted carefully however that the
direction of the imps' flight was to the north-west.</p>

<p>A council was now held by Raiko's band,
and it was decided that the lurking-place of
the demons must be in the mountains of Oy&eacute;
in the province of Tango. It was resolved
to hunt out and destroy the imps.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>URING the time in which Watanab&eacute;
was forming his plan to
destroy the onis that lurked in
the Oy&eacute; mountains, the brave
Raiko fell sick, and daily grew
weaker and paler. When the demons found
this out they sent the three-eyed imp called
Mitsum&eacute; Kozo, to plague him.</p>

<p>This imp, which had a snout like a hog's,
three monstrous blue eyes, and a mouth full
of tusks, was glad that the brave soldier
could no longer fight the onis. He would
approach the sick man in his chamber, leer
horribly at him, loll out his tongue, and pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
down the lids of his eyes with his hairy
fingers, until the sight sickened Raiko more
and more.</p>

<p>But Raiko, well or ill, always slept with
his trusty sword under his pillow, and pretending
to be greatly afraid, and to cower
under the bed-clothes, the kozo grew bolder
and bolder. When the imp was near the
bed, Raiko drew his blade, and cut the oni
across his huge double nose. This made the
demon howl, and he ran away, leaving
tracks of blood.</p>

<p>When Tsuna and his band heard of their
brave master's exploit, they came to congratulate
him, and offered to hunt out the
demon and destroy him.</p>

<p>They followed the red drops until they
came to a cavern in the mountains. Entering
this they saw in the gloom a spider six
feet high, with legs as long as a fishing-pole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and as thick as a daikon radish. Two great
yellow eyes glared at them like lamps. They
noticed a great gaping wound as if done by
a sword-cut on his snout.</p>

<p>It was a horrible, nasty hairy thing to
fight with swords, since to get near enough,
they would be in danger of the creature's
claws. So Tsuna went and chopped down
a tree as thick as a man's leg, leaving the
roots on, while his comrades prepared a rope
to tie up the monster like a fly in a web.
Then with a loud yell Tsuna rushed at the
spider, felled him with a blow, and held him
down with the tree and roots so he could
not bite or use his claws. Seeing this, his
comrades rushed in, and bound the monster's
legs tight to his body so that he could
not move. Drawing their swords they
passed them through his body and finished
him. Returning in triumph to the city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
they found their dear captain recovered
from his illness.</p>

<p>Raiko thanked his brave warriors for
their exploits, made a feast for them, and
gave them many presents. At this feast
Captain Raiko told them that he had received
orders from the mikado to march
against the oni's den in Tango, slaughter
them all, and rescue the prisoners he should
find there. Then he showed them his commission
written in large letters,</p>

<p>"I command you, Raiko, to chastise the
onis."</p>

<p>He also allowed them to examine the
gold brocade bag, in which it was kept, and
which one of the fair ladies of the court had
made for him with her own tapering fingers.</p>

<p>At this time many families in Kioto were
grieving over the loss of their children, and
even while Tsuna had been away, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
lovely damsels had been seized and taken to
the demon's den.</p>

<p>Lest the onis might hear of their coming,
and escape, the four trusty men disguised
themselves as Komuso or wandering priests
of the mountains. They put on over their
helmets, huge hats like wash-bowls, made of
straw, woven so tightly that no one could
see their faces. They covered their armor
with very cheap and common clothes, and
then after worshipping at the shrines, began
their march.</p>

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>UITE PATHLESS were the desolate
mountains of Tango, for no
one ever went into them except
once in a while a poor woodcutter
or charcoal-burner; yet
Raiko and his men set out with stout hearts.
There were no bridges over the streams,
and frightful precipices abounded. Once
they had to stop and build a bridge by felling
a tree, and walking across it over a dangerous
chasm. Once they came to a steep
rock, to descend which they must make a
ladder of creeping vines. At last they
reached a dense grove at the top of a cliff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
far up to the clouds, which seemed as if it
might contain the demon's castle.</p>

<p>Approaching, they found a pretty maiden
washing some clothes which had spots of
blood on them. They said to her, "Sister,
Miss, why are you here, and what are you
doing?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said she, with a deep sigh, "you
must not come here. This is the haunt of
demons. They eat human flesh and they
will eat yours." "Look there" said she
pointing to a pile of white bones of men,
women and children, "You must go down
the mountain as quickly as you came." Saying
this she burst into tears.</p>

<p>But instead of being frightened or sorrowful,
the brave fellows nearly danced for
joy. "We have come here for the purpose
of destroying the demons by the mikado's
orders," said Raiko, patting his breast, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
inside his dress in the damask bag was the
imperial order.</p>

<p>At this the maiden dried her tears and
smiled so sweetly that Raiko's heart was
touched by her beauty.</p>

<p>"But how came you to live among these
cannibal demons," asked Raiko.</p>

<p>She blushed deeply as she replied sadly
"Although they eat men and old women,
they keep the young maidens to wait on
them."</p>

<p>"It's a great pity" said Raiko, "but we
shall now avenge our fellow subjects of the
mikado, as well as your shame and cruel
treatment, if you will show us the way up
the cliff to the den."</p>

<p>They began to climb the hill but they
had not gone far before they met a young
oni who was a cook in the great d&#333;ji's
kitchen. He was carrying a human limb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
for his master's lunch. They gnashed their
teeth silently, and clutched their swords
under their coats. Yet they courteously
saluted the cook-demon, and asked for an
interview with the chief. The demon
smiled in his sleeve, thinking what a fine
dinner his master would make of the four
men.</p>

<p>A few feet forward, and a turn in the path
brought them to the front of the demon's
castle. Among tall and mighty boulders of
rock, which loomed up to the clouds, there
was an opening in the dense groves, thickly
covered with vines and mosses like an arbor.
From this point, the view over the plains
below commanded a space of hundreds of
miles. In the distance the red pagodas,
white temple-gables and castle towers of
Kioto were visible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>Inside the cave was a banqueting hall
large enough to seat one hundred persons.
The floor was neatly covered with new, clean
mats of sea-green rice-straw, on which
tables, silken cushions, arm-rests, drinking-cups,
bottles and many other articles of comfort
lay about. The stone walls were richly
decorated with curtains and hangings of fine
silken stuffs.</p>

<p>At the end of the long hall, on a raised
dais, our heroes presently observed, as a
curtain was lifted, the chief demon, Shi-ten
d&#333;ji, of august, yet frightful appearance. He
was seated on a heap of luxurious cushions
made of blue and crimson crape, stuffed
with swan's down. He was leaning on a
golden arm-rest. His body was quite red,
and he was round and fat like a baby grown
up. He had very black hair cut like a small
boy's, and on the top of his head, just peeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
through the hair were two very short
horns. Around him were a score of lovely
maidens&mdash;the fairest of Kioto&mdash;on whose
beautiful faces was stamped the misery they
dared not fully show, yet could not entirely
conceal. Along the wall other demons sat
or lay at full length, each one with his handmaid
seated beside him to wait on him and
pour out his wine. All of them were of
horrible aspect, which only made the beauty
of the maidens more conspicuous. Seeing
our heroes walk in the hall led by the cook,
each one of the demons was as happy as a
spider, when in his lurking hole he feels the
jerk on his web-thread that tells him a fly
is caught. All of them at once poured out
a fresh saucer of sak&eacute; and drank it down.</p>

<p>Raiko and his men separated, and began
talking freely with the demons until the
partitions at one corner were slid aside, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
a troop of little demons who were waiter-boys
entered. They brought in a host of
dishes, and the onis fell to and ate. The
noise of their jaws sounded like the pounding
of a rice mill.</p>

<p>Our heroes were nearly sickened at the
repast, for it consisted chiefly of human flesh,
while the wine-cups were made of empty
human skulls. However, they laughed and
talked and excused themselves from eating,
saying they had just lunched.</p>

<p>As the demons drank more and more they
grew lively, laughed till the cave echoed,
and sang uproarious songs. Every time
they grinned, they showed their terrible
tusks, and teeth like fangs. All of them had
horns, though most of these were very short.</p>

<p>The d&#333;ji became especially hilarious, and
drank the health of every one of his four
guests in a skull full of wine. To supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
him there was a tub full of sak&eacute; at hand,
and his usual drinking-vessel was a dish
which seemed to Tsuma to be as large as a
full moon.</p>
</div>

<p>Raiko now offered to return the courtesies
shown them by dancing "the Kioto dance,"
for which he was famous. Stepping out into
the centre of the hall, with his fan in one
hand, he danced gracefully and with such
wonderful ease, that the onis screamed with
delight, and clapped their hands in applause,
saying they had never seen anything to
equal it. Even the maidens, lost in admiration
of the polished courtier, forgot their
sorrow, and felt as happy for the time as
though they were at home dancing.</p>

<p>The dance finished, Raiko took from his
bosom a bottle of sak&eacute;, and offered it to the
chief demon as a gift, saying it was the best
wine of Sakai. The delighted d&#333;ji drank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
gave a sip to each of his lords saying, "This
is the best liquor I ever tasted, you must
drink the health of our friends in it."</p>

<p>Now Raiko had bought, at the most skillful
druggists' in the capital, a powerful sleeping
potion, and mixed it with the wine,
which made it taste very sweet. In a few
minutes all the demons had dropped off
asleep, and their snores sounded like the
rolling thunder of the mountains.</p>

<p>Then Raiko rose up and gave the signal
to his comrades. Whispering to the maidens
to leave the room quietly, they drew their
swords, and with as little noise as possible
cut the throats of the demons. No sound
was heard but the gurgling of blood that
ran out in floods on the floor. The d&#333;ji
lying like a lion on his cushions was still
sleeping, the snores issuing out of his nose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
like thunder from a cloud. The four warriors
approached him and like loyal vassals
as they were, they first turned their faces
towards Kioto, reverenced the mikado, and
prayed for the blessing of the gods who made
Japan. Raiko then drew near, and measuring
the width of the doji's neck with his
sword found that it would be short. Suddenly,
the blade lengthened of itself. Then
lifting his weapon, he smote with all his
might and cut the neck clean through.</p>

<p>In an instant, the bloody head flew up in
the air gnashing its teeth and rolling its
yellow eyes, while the horns sprouted out
to a horrible length, the jaws opening and
shutting like the edges of an earthquake
fissure. It flew up and whirled round the
room seven times. Then with a rush it flew
at Raiko's head, and bit through the straw
hat and into the iron helmet inside. But this
final effort exhausted its strength, it's motions
ceased and it fell heavily to the floor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>Anxiously the comrades helped their
fallen leader to rise, and examined his head.
But he was unhurt,&mdash;not a scratch was on
him. Then the heroes congratulated each
other and after despatching the smaller
demons, brought out all the treasure and
divided it equally. Then they set the castle
on fire and buried the bones of the victims,
setting up a stone to mark the spot. All
the maidens and captives were assembled
together, and in great state and pomp they
returned to Kioto. The virgins were restored
to their parents, and many a desolate
home was made joyful, and many mourning
garments taken off. Raiko was honored by
the mikado in being made a kug&eacute; (court
noble,) and was appointed Chief of the entire
garrison of Kiot&#333;. Then all the people
were grateful for his valor.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>AZAY&Eacute; is a shell-fish, which is
very proud of its shell. This is
high, full of points like towers,
and thick like a castle wall.
When feeding, enjoying itself or
moving around, its long neck and body are
stretched out before it, armed with its hard
operculum, which is like an iron shield, or
the end of a battering ram. The operculum
fits the entrance to its shell like a trap door.
As soon as any danger is near it pulls in its
head, and slams itself shut with a loud noise.</p>

<p>On account of the hardness and thickness
of his shell, the sazay&eacute; is the envy of the
soft-bodied fishes that covet his security.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>But on the other hand the sazay&eacute;, though a
slow moving creature, is apt to be too proud
of his defence and trust too much to his
fancied security.</p>
<hr class="hr15" />


<p>One day a Tai (red fish) and a Herring
were looking at the strong shell of the sazay&eacute;,
and becoming quite envious, the Tai said:</p>

<p>"What a mighty strong castle you do live
in, Mr. Sazay&eacute;. When you once shut up
your shell no one need even try to touch
you. You are to be envied sir."</p>

<p>The Sazay&eacute; was tickled at the flattery,
but pretending to be very humble, shook
his head and said:</p>

<p>"It is very kind in you, my lords, to say
so, but my little hut is nothing but a shell;
yet I must say that when I lock my door I
do not feel any anxiety, and I really pity
you poor fellows who have no shell at all."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>He had hardly got the last word out of
his grisly throat, when suddenly there was a
great splash, and away darted the tai and
herring, never resting their fins or tails a
moment till safe out of danger.</p>

<p>The Sazay&eacute; drew in his flap in the twinkling
of an eye, and keeping as quiet as possible,
wondered what the noise was. Was it
a stone, or a net, or a fish-hook? He wondered
if the tai and herring were caught.</p>

<p>"Surely they must be," thought he.
"However I'm safe, thanks to my castle
shell," he muttered.</p>

<p>So drawing his trap tighter he took a long
nap. When he woke up, quite refreshed, he
cautiously loosened his trap and peeped out.</p>

<p>"How strange every thing looks, am I
dreaming?" said he as he saw piles of fish,
clams, prawns and lobsters lying on a board
all around him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ugh, what is that?" clapping himself
shut as a great black-nosed and long-whiskered
dog poked his muzzle near him.</p>

<p>Poor shell-fish! There he lay in a fishmonger's
shop, with a slip of paper marked
"ten cash," (1-10 of a cent,) on his back. A
few hours later, purchased by a laborer's
wife for his dinner, he was stewing along
with several of his relative's in his own
juice. The castle, of which he was so proud,
serving first as a dinner-pot, then as a saucer,
after which it was thrown away in a
heap and burned into lime.

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>EDO people are very fond of broiled
eels. A rich merchant, named
Kisaburo, who was very miserly
with his money, once moved his
quarters next door to the shop of
one Kichibei, who caught and cooked eels
for a living. During the night Mr. Kichibei
caught his stock in trade, and in the day-time
served them, smoking hot, to his customers.
Cut into pieces three or four inches
long, they were laid to sizzle on a grid-iron
over red hot charcoal, which was kept
in a glow by constant fanning.</p>

<p>Kisaburo, wishing to save money, and
having a strong imagination, daily took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
seat at meal time close to his neighbor's door.
Eating his boiled rice, and snuffing in the
odors of the broiled eels, as they were wafted
in, he enjoyed with his nose, what he would
not pay for to put in his mouth. In this
way, as he flattered himself, he saved much
money, and his strong box grew daily
heavier.</p>

<p>Kichibei, the eel-broiler, on finding this
out, thought he would charge his stingy
neighbor for the smell of his eels. So, making
out his bill he presented it to Kisaburo,
who seemed to be much pleased. He called
to his wife to bring his iron-bound money
box, which was done. Emptying out the
shining mass of <i>kobans</i> (oval gold pieces,
worth five or six dollars), <i>ichi-bu</i> and <i>ni-bu</i>
(square silver pieces, worth a quarter and a
half dollar respectively) he jingled the coins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
at a great rate, and then touching the eel-man's
bill with his fan, bowed, low and said
with a smile:

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>F ALL the beautiful objects in
"the land of the holy gods," as
the Japanese call their country,
none are more beautiful than
Fuji Mountain and Lake Biwa.
The one is a great cone of white snow, the
other is a sheet of heaven-blue water, in
shape like a lute with four strings.</p>

<p>Sweeping from twenty square leagues of
space out of the plain and rising twelve
thousand feet in air, Fuji, or Fusi Yama,
casts its sunset shadow far out on the ocean,
and from fourteen provinces gleams the
splendor of its snowy crest. It sits like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
king on his throne in the heart of Suruga
Province.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty miles to the west
as the crane wings her flight, in the heart of
Omi, is Biwa Ko, the lake of the lute. It is
sixty miles long and as blue as the sky
whose mirror it is. Along its banks rise
white-walled castles and stretch mulberry
plantations. On its bosom rise wooded
islands, white, but not with frost; for thousands
of herons nestle on the branches of
the trees, like lilies on their stems. Down
under the blue depths, say the people, is the
Dragon shrine (Riu Gu), where dwell the
dragon-helmed Kai Riu O, and his consort,
the shell-crowned Queen of the World
Under the Sea.</p>

<p>Why do the pilgrims from all over the
empire exclaim joyfully, while climbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Fuji's cinder-beds and lava-blocks, "I am a
man of Omi"? Why, when quenching their
thirst with the melted snow-water of Fuji
crater, do they cry out "I am drinking from
Lake Biwa"? Why do the children clap
their hands, as they row or sail over Biwa's
blue surface, and say: "I am on top of Fuji
Yama"?</p>

<p>To these questions the Japanese legend
gives answer.</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>When Heaven and earth were first created,
there was neither Lake of Biwa nor Mountain
of Fuji. Suruga and Omi were both
plains. Even for long after men inhabited
Japan and the Mikados had ruled for centuries
there was neither earth so nigh to
heaven nor water so close to the Under-world
as the peaks of Fuji and the bottom
of Biwa. Men drove the plow and planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the rice over the very spot where crater and
deepest depth now are.</p>

<p>But one night in the ancient times there
was a terrible earthquake. All the world
shook, the clouds lowered to the earth, floods
of water poured from the sky, and a sound
like the fighting of a myriad of dragons filled
the air. In the morning all was serene and
calm. The sky was blue. The earth was
as bright and all was as "white-faced" as
when the sun goddess first came out from
her hiding in the cave.</p>

<p>The people of Omi awoke, scarce expecting
to find either earth or heaven, when lo!
they looked on what had yesterday been
tilled land or barren moor, and there was a
great sheet of blue. Was it sky? Had a
sheet of the "blue field of heaven" fallen
down? Was it the ocean? They came
near it, tasted it. It was fresh and sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
as a fountain-rill. They looked at it from
the hill-tops, and, seeing its outline, called
it "the lake of the four-stringed lute."
Others, proud of their new possession, named
it the Lake of Omi.</p>

<p>Greater still was the surprise of the Suruga
people. The sailors, far out at sea, rubbed
their eyes and wondered at the strange
shape of the towering white cloud. Was it
the Iwakura, the eternal throne of Heaven,
come down to rest on earth out of the many
piled white clouds of heaven? Some
thought they had lost their reckoning; but
were assured when they recognized familiar
landmarks on shore. Many a cottager woke
up to find his house, which lay in a valley
the day before, was now far up on the slope,
with the distant villages and the sea visible;
while far, far above shone the snowy head of
a mountain, whose crown lay in the blue sky.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>At night the edges of the peak, like white
fingers, seemed to pluck the stars from the
Milky Way.</p>

<p>"What shall we call this new-born child
of the gods?" said the people. And various
names were proposed.</p>

<p>"There is no other mountain so beautiful
in all the earth, there's not its equal anywhere;
therefore call it Fuji, (no two such),
the peerless, the matchless mountain," said
one.</p>

<p>"It is so tall, so comely, so grand, call it
Fuji, (rich scholar, the lordly mountain),"
said another.</p>

<p>"Call it Fuji, (never dying, the immortal
mountain)," said a third.</p>
</div>

<p>"Call it, after the festal flower of joy,
Fuji" (Wistaria) said another, as he decked
the peak of his hat with the drooping clusters
of the tender blue blossom. "It looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
blue and purple in the distance, just like the
fuji flower." Various as the meanings of
the name were, they sounded all alike to the
ear. So, without any quarreling, all agreed
to call it Fuji and each to choose his own
meaning. To this day, though many a
learned dispute and the scratching of the
written character on the sand with walking
stick, or on paper with pencil, or on the
palm of the hand with forefinger takes place,
all pronounce the name alike as they rave
on the beauties of Fuji Yama.</p>

<p>So went forth into the countries bounding
"the four seas" the belief that there was a
white mountain of perfect form in Japan,
and that whoever ascended it would live
long and even attain immortality; and that
somewhere on the mountain was hidden the
elixir of immortality, which if any one drank
he would live forever. Now in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
kingdoms of far-off China there lived a rich
old king, who had abundance of treasures,
health, and many children. But he did not
wish to die, and, hence, spent his days in
studying the lore and arts of the alchemists,
who believed they would finally attain to
the transmutation of lead into gold, find the
universal solvent of all things, the philosophers'
stone, the elixir of life, and all the
wondrous secrets which men in Europe long
afterward labored to discover.</p>

<p>Among the king's sages was one old man
of mighty wisdom, who had heard of the
immortal mountain of Japan, and, learning
of the manner of its appearance, concluded
that the Japan Archipelago contained the
Fortunate Isles and in it was the true elixir
of life. He divulged his secret to the king,
and advised him to make the journey to the
Land of the Rising Sun.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>Overjoyed at the good news and the faithfulness
of his loyal sage, the king loaded
him with gifts and honors. He selected
five hundred of the most beauteous youths
and virgins of his kingdom, and, fitting out
a fleet, sailed away to the Happy Isles of
the East. Coasting along the shore until
they recognized the glorious form of the
mountain, they landed and began the
ascent. Alas! for the poor king. The
rough sea and severe storms had worn on
his aged frame and the fatigues of the ascent
were so great, that before reaching the top
he fainted away, and before the head of the
procession had set foot on the crater edge
the monarch was dead. Sadly they gave
up the search for the elixir of life, and, descending
the mountain, buried their master
in the Province of Kii. Then, in their exuberance
of youth and joy, thinking little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
of the far future and wishing to enjoy the
present, they separated in couples, married,
and, disposing of their ship and cargo, settled
in the country, and colonized the eastern
part of Japan.</p>

<p>Long afterward, when Buddhist believers
came to Japan, one of them, climbing Fuji,
noticed that around its sunken crater were
eight peaks, like the petals of their sacred
lotus flower. Thus, it seemed to them,
Great Buddha had honored Japan, by bestowing
the sacred symbol of Nirvana, or
Heaven, on the proudest and highest part
of Japan. So they also named it Fuji, "the
sacred mountain"; and to this day all the
world calls this sacred mountain Fuji, or
Fusi Yama, while the Japanese people believe
that the earth which sunk in Omi is
the same which, piled to the clouds, is the
lordly mountain of Suruga.

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG, LONG, AGO, when the oldest
stork was young, there lived
an aged woodcutter and his son
on the slopes of the mountain
Tagi, in the province of Mino.
They gained a frugal livelihood by cutting
brushwood on the hill-side, and carrying it
in bundles on their back to sell in the nearest
market town; for they were too poor to
own an ox. With the money thus received
they bought rice and radishes, their daily
food.</p>

<p>Only once or twice a year, at New
Year's and on the mikado's birthday, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
they afford to treat themselves to a mess of
bean-curd or fresh fish. Yet the old man
was very fond of rice-wine, and every week
bought a gourd full to keep his old blood
warm.</p>

<p>As the years rolled on the aged father's
limbs became so stiff that he was unable any
longer to climb the mountains. So his son,
now grown to be a sturdy man, cut nearly
double the quantity of wood and thus kept
the family larder full. The old man was so
proud of his son that he daily stood at sunset
in front of his rustic gate to welcome
him back. And to see the old daddy and
the young stripling remove their headkerchiefs,
and bow with hands on knees in
polite fashion, bending their backs and sucking
in their breath, out of respect to each
other, and to hear them inquiring after one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
another's health, showering mutual compliments
all the time, one would have thought
they had not seen each other for eight years,
instead of eight hours.</p>

<p>One winter the snow fell long and thick,
until all the ground in field and forest was
covered several feet over. The bamboo
branches bent with their weight of white,
the pine boughs broke under their load, and
even the stone idols along the wayside were
covered up. At first, even with the hardest
work, the young woodcutter could scarcely
get and sell wood to buy enough food to
keep them both alive. He often went hungry
himself, so that his father might have
his warm wine.</p>

<p>One day he went by another path up one
of the mountain dells with his rope basket
strapped to his back, and the empty gourd-bottle
at his belt. While gloomily grieving
over his hard luck, the faint odor of rice-wine
seemed borne on the breeze.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>He snuffed the air. It was no mistake.
"Here's luck, surely," said he, throwing
down his bundle.</p>

<p>Hurrying forward he saw a foaming waterfall
tumbling over the rocks in a thick stream.</p>

<p>As he drew near, some of the spray fell
on his tongue. He tasted it, smacked his
lips and throwing down his cord and basket
to the ground, filled his gourd and hastened
home to his father.</p>

<p>Every day, till the end of his father's life,
did he come to this wonderful cascade of
wine, and thus the old man was nourished
for many a long year.</p>

<p>The news of this fountain of youth spread
abroad until it reached the court. The
mikado, hearing of it, made a journey to
Mino to see the wonderful waterfall. In
honor of this event, and as a reward of filial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
piety, the name of the year-period was
changed to Yoro, (Nourishing Old Age).</p>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>To this day, many people young and old
go out to enjoy picnic parties at the foot of
the waterfall; which now, however, runs
honest water only, which makes the cheeks
red; and not the wonderful wine that once
tipped the old daddy's nose with perpetual
vermilion.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>UKASHI, MUKASHI, (as most
Japanese stories begin), long,
long ago, when the gods came
down from heaven to subdue the
earth for the mikados, and civilize
the country, there were a great many
earthquakes, and nothing to stop them. The
world continually rocked, and men's houses
and lives were never safe.</p>

<p>Now the two gods who were charged with
the work of subduing the northeastern part
of the world were Kashima and Katori.
Having done their work well, and quieted
all the enemies of the Sun-goddess, they
came to the province of Hitachi. Kashima,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
sticking his sword into the earth, ran it
through to the other side, leaving the hilt
above the ground. In the course of centuries
this mighty sword shrunk and turned to
stone, and the people gave it the name of
<i>Kanam&eacute; ishi</i>, (The rock of Kanam&eacute;).</p>

<p>Now Kanam&eacute; means the rivet in a fan,
that holds all the sticks together, and they
gave the name "rivet-rock," because it is
the rivet that binds the earth together. No
one could ever lift this rock except Kashima
the mighty one who first set it in the earth.</p>

<p>Yet even Kashima never raises it, except
to stop an earthquake of unusual violence.
When the earth quivers, it is because the
great earthquake-fish or <i>jishin-uwo</i> is restless
or angry. This <i>jishin-uwo</i> is a great
creature something like a catfish. It is about
seven hundred miles long, and holds the
world on its back. Its tail is at Awomori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
in the north, and the base of its head is at
Kioto, so that all Japan lies on top of it.
To his mouth are attached huge twirling
feelers, which are just like the hideous moustaches
which the hairy-faced men from beyond
the <i>Tai-kai</i> (Pacific Ocean) wear on
their lips. As soon as these begin to move,
it is a sign that the monster is in wrath.
When he gets angry, and flaps his tail or
bumps his head, there is an earthquake.
When he flounders about or rolls over, there
is terrible destruction of life and property
on the surface of the earth above.</p>

<p>In order to keep the earthquake-fish quiet,
the great giant Kashima is appointed to
watch him. His business is to stand near
by, and when the monster becomes violent
Kashima must jump up and straddle him,
and hold his gills, put his foot on his fin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and when necessary lift up the great rock
of Kanam&eacute; and hold him down with its
weight. Then he becomes perfectly quiet,
and the earthquake ceases. Hence the people
sing this earthquake verse:</p>
</div>

<div class="center">
<p class="center">"No monster can move the Kanam&eacute; rock<br />
Though he tug at it never so hard,<br />
For over it stands, resisting the shock,<br />
The Kashima Kami on guard."<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">Another verse they sing as follows:<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">"These are things<br />
An earthquake brings;<br />
At nine of the bell they sickness fortell,<br />
At five and seven betoken rain,<br />
At four the sky is cleared thereby,<br />
At six and eight comes wind again."<br /></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NLY a few years ago there was a
gentleman in Fukui, Japan, who
had a son, a bright lad of twelve,
who was very diligent at school
and had made astonishing progress
in his studies. He was especially quick
at learning Chinese characters, of which
every Japanese gentleman who wishes to be
called educated must know at least two
thousand. For, although the Chinese and
Japanese are two very different languages,
yet the Japanese, Coreans and Chinese use
the same letters to write with, just as English,
Germans, French and Spaniards all
employ one and the same alphabet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>Now Gojiro's father had promised him
that when he read through five volumes of
the Nihongi, or Ancient History of Japan,
he would give him for a present a book of
wonderful Chinese stories. Gojiro performed
his task, and his father kept his
promise. One day on his return from a
journey to Kioto, he presented his son with
sixteen volumes, all neatly silk-bound, well
illustrated with wood-cuts, and printed
clearly on thin, silky mulberry paper, from
the best wooden blocks. It will be remembered
that several volumes of Japanese literature
make but one of ours, as they are
much lighter and thinner than ours.</p>

<p>Gojiro was so delighted with the wonderful
stories of heroes and warriors, travelers
and sailors, that he almost felt himself in
China. He read far into the night, with the
lamp inside of his musquito curtain; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
finally fell asleep, still undressed, but with
his head full of all sorts of Chinese wonders.</p>

<p>He dreamed he was far away in China,
walking along the banks of the great Yellow
River. Everything was very strange.
The people talked an entirely different
language from his own; had on different
clothes; and, instead of the nice shaven head
and top-knot of the Japanese, every one
wore a long pigtail of hair, that dangled at
his heels. Even the boats were of a strange
form, and on the fishing smacks perched on
projecting rails, sat rows of cormorants,
each with a ring around his neck. Every
few minutes one of them would dive under
the water, and after a while come struggling
up with a fish in its mouth, so big that the
fishermen had to help the bird into the boat.
The game was then flung into a basket, and
the cormorant was treated to a slice of raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
fish, by way of encouragement and to keep
the bird from the bad habit of eating the
live fish whole. This the ravenous bird
would sometimes try to do, even though the
ring was put around his neck for the express
purpose of preventing him from gulping
down a whole fish at once.</p>

<p>It was springtime, and the buds were
just bursting into flower. The river was
full of fish, especially of carp, ascending to
the great rapids or cascades. Here the current
ran at a prodigious rate of swiftness,
and the waters rippled and boiled and roared
with frightful noise. Yet, strange to say,
many of the fish were swimming up the
stream as if their lives depended on it.
They leaped and floundered about; but
every one seemed to be tossed back and left
exhausted in the river, where they panted
and gasped for breath in the eddies at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
side. Some were so bruised against the
rocks that, after a few spasms, they floated
white and stiff, belly up, on the water, dead,
and were swept down the stream. Still the
shoal leaped and strained every fin, until
their scales flashed in the sun like a host of
armored warriors in battle. Gojiro, enjoying
it as if it were a real conflict of wave
and fishes, clapped his hands with delight.</p>

<p>Then Gojiro inquired, by means of writing,
of an old white-bearded sage standing
by and looking on: "What is the name of
this part of the river?"</p>

<p>"We call it Lung Men," said the sage.</p>

<p>"Will you please write the characters for
it," said Gojiro, producing his ink-case and
brush-pen, with a roll of soft mulberry paper.</p>

<p>The sage wrote the two Chinese characters,
meaning "The Gate of the Dragons,"
or "Dragons' Gate," and turned away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
watch a carp that seemed almost up into
smooth water.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see," said Gojiro to himself.
"That's pronounced Riu Mon in Japanese.
I'll go further on and see. There must be
some meaning in this fish-climbing." He
went forward a few rods, to where the
banks trended upward into high bluffs,
crowned by towering firs, through the top
branches of which fleecy white clouds
sailed slowly along, so near the sky did the
tree-tops seem. Down under the cliffs the
river ran perfectly smooth, almost like a
mirror, and broadened out to the opposite
shore. Far back, along the current, he
could still see the rapids shelving down. It
was crowded at the bottom with leaping
fish, whose numbers gradually thinned out
toward the center; while near the top, close
to the edge of level water, one solitary fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of powerful fin and tail, breasted the steep
stream. Now forward a leap, then a slide
backward, sometimes further to the rear
than the next leap made up for, then steady
progress, then a slip, but every moment
nearer, until, clearing foam and ripple and
spray at one bound, it passed the edge and
swam happily in smooth water.</p>

<p>It was inside the Dragon Gate.</p>

<p>Now came the wonderful change. One
of the fleecy white clouds suddenly left the
host in the deep blue above, dipped down
from the sky, and swirling round and round
as if it were a water spout, scratched and
frayed the edge of the water like a fisher's
troll. The carp saw and darted toward it.
In a moment the fish was transformed into
a white dragon, and, rising into the cloud,
floated off toward Heaven. A streak or two
of red fire, a gleam of terrible eyes, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
flash of white scales was all that Gojiro saw.
Then he awoke.</p>

<p>"How strange that a poor little carp, a
common fish that lives in the river, should
become a great white dragon, and soar up
into the sky, to live there," thought Gojiro,
the next day, as he told his mother of his
dream.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she; "and what a lesson for
you. See how the carp persevered, leaping
over all difficulties, never giving up till it
became a dragon. I hope my son will
mount over all obstacles, and rise to honor
and to high office under the government."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! now I see!" said Gojiro. "That
is what my teacher means when he says the
students in Tokio have a saying, 'I'm a
fish to day, but I hope to be a dragon to-morrow,'
when they go to attend examination;
and that's what Papa meant when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>he said: 'That fish's son, Kofuku, has
become a white dragon, while I am yet only
a carp.'"

<p>So on the third day of the third month,
at the Feast of Flags, Gojiro hoisted the
<i>nobori</i>. It was a great fish, made of paper,
fifteen feet long and hollow like a bag. It
was yellow, with black scales and streaks of
gold, and red gills and mouth, in which two
strong strings were fastened. It was hoisted
up by a rope to the top of a high bamboo
pole on the roof of the house. There the
breeze caught it, swelled it out round and
full of air. The wind made the fins work,
and the tail flap, and the head tug, until it
looked just like a carp trying to swim the
rapids of the Yellow River&mdash;the symbol of
ambition and perseverance.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>OVELY AND BRIGHT in the
month of May, at the time of rice-planting,
was the day on which
the daimio, Lord Long-legs, was
informed by his chamberlain,
Hop-hop, that on the morrow his lordship's
retinue would be in readiness to accompany
their worshipful Lord Long-legs on his
journey. This Lord Long-legs was a daimio
who ruled over four acres of rice-field in
Echizen, whose revenue was ten thousand
rice-stalks. His retainers, who were all
grasshoppers, numbered over six thousand,
while his court consisted only of nobles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
such as Mantis, Beetle, and Pinching-bug.
The maids of honor who waited on his queen
Katydid, were lady-bugs, butterflies, and
goldsmiths, and his messengers were fire-flies
and dragon-flies. Once in a while a
beetle was sent on an errand; but these
stupid fellows had such a habit of running
plump into things, and bumping their heads
so badly that they always forgot what they
were sent for. Besides these, he had a great
many servants in the kitchen&mdash;such as
grubs, spiders, toads, etc. The entire population
of his dominion, including the common
folks, numbered several millions, and
ranked all the way from horse-flies down to
ants, mosquitoes, and ticks.</p>

<p>Many of his subjects were very industrious
and produced fine fabrics, which, however,
were seized and made use of by great monsters,
called men. Thus the gray worms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
kept spinning-wheels in their heads. They
had a fashion of eating mulberry leaves, and
changing them into fine threads, called silk.
The wasps made paper, and the bees distilled
honey. There was another insect
which spread white wax on the trees. These
were all retainers or friendly vassals of Lord
Long-legs.</p>

<p>Now it was Lord Long-legs' duty once a
year to go up to Yedo to pay his respects to
the great Tycoon and to spend several weeks
in the Eastern metropolis. I shall not take
the time nor tax the patience of my readers
in telling about all the bustle and preparation
that went on in the yashiki (mansion)
of Lord Long-legs for a whole week previous
to starting. Suffice it to say that clothes
were washed and starched, and dried on a
board, to keep them from shrinking; trunks
and baskets were packed; banners and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
umbrellas were put in order; the lacquer on
the brass ornaments; shields and swords
and spears were all polished; and every little
item was personally examined by the
daimio's chief inspector. This functionary
was a black-and-white-legged mosquito, who,
on account of his long nose, could pry into
a thing further and see it easier than any
other of his lordship's officers; and, if anything
went wrong, he could make more noise
over it than any one else. As for the retainers,
down to the very last lackey and
coolie, each one tried to outshine the other
in cleanliness and spruce dress.</p>

<p>The Bumble-bee brushed off the pollen
from his legs; and the humbler Honey-bee,
after allowing his children to suck his
paws, to get the honey sticking to them,
spruced up and listened attentively to the
orders read to him by the train-leader, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Locust, who prided himself on being seventeen
years old, and looked on all the others
as children. He read from a piece of wasp-nest
paper: "No leaving the line to suck
flowers, except at halting-time." The Blue-tailed
Fly washed his hands and face over
and over again. The lady-bugs wept many
tears, because they could not go with the
company; the crickets chirped rather
gloomily, because none with short limbs
could go on the journey; while Daddy
Long-legs almost turned a somersault for joy
when told he might carry a bundle in the
train. All being in readiness, the procession
was to start at six o'clock in the morning.
The exact minute was to be announced
by the time-keeper of the mansion, Flea
san, whose house was on the back of Neko,
a great black cat, who lived in the porter's
lodge of the castle, near by. Flea san was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
to notice the opening or slits in the monster's
moony-green eyes, which when closed
to a certain width would indicate six o'clock.
Then with a few jumps she was to announce
it to a mosquito friend of hers, who would
fly with the news to the gate-keeper of the
yashiki, one Whirligig by name.</p>

<p>So, punctually to the hour, the great
double gate swung wide open, and the procession
passed out and marched on over the
hill. All the servants of Lord Long-legs
were out, to see the grand sight. They
were down on their knees, saying: "O
shidzukani," (please go slowly). When their
master's palanquin passed, they bowed their
heads to the dust, as was proper. The ladies,
who were left behind, cried bitterly, and
soaked their paper handkerchiefs with tears,
especially one fair brown creature, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
next of kin to Lord Long-legs, being an ant
on his mother's side.</p>

<p>The procession was closed by six old
daddies (spiders), marching two by two,
who were a little stupid and groggy, having
had a late supper, and a jolly feast the night
before. When the great gate slammed shut,
one of them caught the end of his foot in it,
and was lamed for the rest of the journey.
This old Daddy Long-legs, hobbling along,
with a bundle on his back, was the only
funny thing in the procession, and made
much talk among bystanders on the road.</p>

<p>This is the order and the way they looked.
First there went out, far ahead, a plump, tall
Mantis, with a great long baton of grass,
which he swung to and fro before him, from
right to left, (like a drum-major), crying
out: "<i>Shitaniro</i>, down on your knees!
Get down with you!" Whereat all the ants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
bugs and lizards at once bent their forelegs,
and the toads, which were already squatting,
bobbed their noses in the dust. Even the
mud-turtles poked their heads out of the
water to see what was going on. All the
worms and grubs who lived up in trees or
tall bushes had to come down to the ground.
It was forbidden to any insect to remain on
a high stalk of grass, lest he might look
down on His Highness. Even the Inch-worm
had to wind himself up and stop
measuring his length, while the line was
passing. And in case of grubs or moths in
the nest or cocoon, too young to crawl out,
the law compelled their parents to cover
them over with a leaf. It would be an insult
to Lord Long-legs to look down on him.
Next followed two lantern-bearers, holding
glow-worms for lanterns in their fore-paws.
These were wrapped in cases made of leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
which they took off at night. Behind were six
fire-flies, well supplied with self-acting lamps,
which they kept hidden somewhere under
their wings. Next marched four abreast
the band of little weevils, carrying the umbrellas
of state, which were morning-glories&mdash;some
open, some shut. Behind them
strutted four green grasshoppers, who were
spear-bearers, carrying pink blossoms. Just
before the palanquin were two tall dandies,
high lords themselves and of gigantic stature
and imposing bellies, who, with arms akimbo
and feelers far up in the air, bore aloft high
over all the insignia of their Lord Long-legs.
All these fellows strutted along on
their hind legs, their backs as stiff as a hemp
stalk, their noses pointing to the stars, and
their legs striding like stilts. The priest in
his robes, a praying beetle, who was chaplain,
walked on solemnly.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile a great crowd of spectators
lined the path; but all were on their knees.
Frogs and toads blinked out of the sides of
their heads. The pretty red lizards glided
out, to see the splendid show; worms stopped
crawling; and all kinds of bugs ceased
climbing, and came down from the grass and
flower-stalks, to bow humbly before the
train of Lord Long-legs. Bug mothers
hastened, with their bug babies on their
backs, down to the road, and, squatting
down, taught their little nits to put their
fore-paws politely together and bow down
on their front knees. No one dared to speak
out loud; but the mole-cricket, nudging his
fellow under the wing, said: "Just look at
that green Mantis! He looks as though 'he
would rush out with a battle-ax on his
shoulder to meet a chariot.' See how he
ogles his fellow!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes; and just behold that bandy-legged
hopper, will you? I could walk better than
that myself," said the other.</p>

<p>"'Sh!" said the mole-cricket. "Here
comes the palanquin."</p>

<p>Everybody now cast a squint up under
their eyebrows, and watched the palanquin
go by. It was made of delicately-woven
striped grass, bound with bamboo threads,
lacquered, and finished with curtains of
gauze, made of dragon-fly wings, through
which Lord Long-legs could peep. It was
borne on the shoulders of four stalwart hoppers,
who, carrying rest-poles of grass,
trudged along, with much sweat and fuss
and wiping of their foreheads, stopping occasionally
to change shoulders. At their
side walked a body-guard of eight hoppers,
armed with pistils, and having side-arms of
sword-grass. They were also provided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
poison-shoots, in case of trouble. Other
bearers followed, keeping step and carrying
the regalia, consisting of chrysanthemum
stalks and blossoms. Then followed, in
double rank, a long string of wasps, who
were for show and nothing more. Between
them, inside, carefully saddled, bridled, and
in full housings, was a horse-fly, led by a
snail, to keep the restive animal from going
at a too rapid pace.</p>

<p>Three big, gawky helmet-headed beetles
next followed, bearing rice-sprouts, with
full heads of rice.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! look there!" cried a little grub
at the side of the road. "See the little
grasshopper riding on his father's back!"</p>

<p>"Hai," said Mother Butterfly, putting one
paw on her baby's neck, for fear of being
arrested for making a noise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>It was so. The little 'hopper, tired of
long walking, had climbed on his father's
back for a ride, holding on by the feelers
and seeing everything.</p>

<p>Finally, toward the end of the procession,
was a great crowd of common 'hoppers,
beetles, and bugs of all sorts, carrying the
presents to be given in Yedo, and the
clothing, food and utensils for the use of
Lord Long-legs on the journey; for the
hotels were sometimes very poor on the
Tokaido high road, and the daimio liked
his comforts. Besides, it was necessary for
Lord Long-legs to travel with proper dignity,
as became a daimio. His messengers
always went before and engaged lodging-places,
as the fleas, spiders and mosquitoes
from other localities, who traveled up and
down the great high road, sometimes occupied
the places first. The procession wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
up by the rear-guard of Daddy Long-legs,
who prevented any insult or disrespect from
the rabble. After the line had passed, insects
could cross the road, traffic and travel
were resumed, and the road was cleared,
while the procession faded from view in the
distance.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>UIET AND SHADY was the spot
in the midst of one of the loveliest
valley landscapes in the
empire, near the banks of the
Hidaka river, where stood the tea-house
kept by one Kojima. It was surrounded on
all sides by glorious mountains, ever robed
with deep forests, silver-threaded with
flashing water-falls, to which the lovers of
nature paid many a visit, and in which
poets were inspired to write stanzas in
praise of the white foam and the twinkling
streamlets. Here the bonzes loved to muse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and meditate, and anon merry picnic parties
spread their mats, looped their canvas
screens, and feasted out of nests of lacquered
boxes, drinking the amber sak&eacute; from cups
no larger nor thicker than an egg-shell,
while the sound of guitar and drum kept
time to dance and song.</p>

<p>The garden of the tea-house was as lovely
a piece of art as the florist's cunning could
produce. Those who emerged from the
deep woods of the lofty hill called the
Dragon's Claw, could see in the tea-house
garden a living copy of the landscape before
them. There were mimic mountains, (ten
feet high), and miniature hills veined by a
tiny, path with dwarfed pine groves, and
tiny bamboo clumps, and a patch of grass for
meadow, and a valley just like the great
gully of the mountains, only a thousand
times smaller, and but twenty feet long. So
perfect was the imitation that even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
miniature irrigated rice-fields, each no larger
than a checker-board, were in full sprout.
To make this little gem of nature in art
complete, there fell from over a rock at one
end a lovely little waterfall two feet high,
which after an angry splash over the stones,
rolled on over an absurdly small beech, all
white-sanded and pebbled, threading its
silver way beyond, until lost in fringes of
lilies and aquatic plants. In one broad space
imitating a lake, was a lotus pond, lined
with iris, in which the fins of gold fish
and silver carp flashed in the sunbeams.
Here and there the nose of a tortoise protruded,
while on a rugged rock sat an old
grandfather surveying the scene with one or
two of his grand-children asleep on his shell
and sunning themselves.</p>

<p>The fame of the tea-house, its excellent
fare, and special delicacy of its mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
trout, sugar-jelly and well-flavored rice-cakes,
drew hundreds of visitors, especially
poetry-parties, and lovers of grand scenery.</p>

<p>Just across the river, which was visible
from the verandah of the tea-house, stood
the lofty firs that surrounded the temple of
the Tendai Buddhists. Hard by was the
pagoda, which painted red peeped between
the trees. A long row of paper-windowed
and tile-roofed dwellings to the right made
up the monastery, in which a snowy eye-browed
but rosy-faced old abbot and some
twenty bonzes dwelt, all shaven-faced and
shaven-pated, in crape robes and straw
sandals, their only food being water and
vegetables.</p>

<p>Not the least noticeable of the array of
stone lanterns, and bronze images with
aureoles round their heads, and incense
burners and holy water tanks, and dragon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
spouts, was the belfry, which stood on a
stone platform. Under its roof hung the
massive bronze bell ten feet high, which,
when struck with a suspended log like a
trip-hammer, boomed solemnly over the
valley and flooded three leagues of space
with the melody which died away as sweetly
as an infant falling in slumber. This
mighty bell was six inches thick and weighed
several tons.</p>

<p>In describing the tea-house across the
river, the story of its sweetest charm, and
of its garden the fairest flower must not be
left untold. Kiyo, the host's daughter, was
a lovely maiden of but eighteen, as graceful
as the bamboo reed swaying in the breeze
of a moonlit summer's eve, and as pretty as
the blossoms of the cherry-tree. Far and
wide floated the fame of Kiyo, like the
fragrance of the white lilies of Ibuki, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the wind sweeping down the mountain
heights, comes perfume-laden to the traveler.</p>

<p>As she busied herself about the garden,
or as her white socks slipped over the mat-laid
floor, she was the picture of grace itself.
When at twilight, with her own hands, she
lighted the gay lanterns that hung in festoons
along the eaves of the tea-house above the
verandah, her bright eyes sparkling, her red
petticoats half visible through her semi-transparent
crape robe, she made many a
young man's heart glow with a strange new
feeling, or burn with pangs of jealousy.</p>

<p>Among the priests that often passed by
the tea-house on their way to the monastery,
were some who were young and handsome.</p>

<p>It was the rule of the monastery that none
of the bonzes should drink sak&eacute; (wine) eat
fish or meat, or even stop at the tea-houses
to talk with women. But one young bonze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
named "Lift-the-Kettle" (after a passage in
the Sanscrit classics) had rigidly kept the
rules. Fish had never passed his mouth;
and as for sak&eacute;, he did not know even its
taste. He was very studious and diligent.
Every day he learned ten new Chinese
characters. He had already read several of
the sacred sutras, had made a good beginning
in Sanskrit, knew the name of every
idol in the temple of the 3,333 images in
Kioto, had twice visited the sacred shrine
of the Capital, and had uttered the prayer
"Namu mi&#333; ho ren g&eacute; ki&#333;," ("Glory be to
the sacred lotus of the law"), counting it on
his rosary, five hundred thousand times.
For sanctity and learning he had no peer
among the young neophytes of the bonzerie.</p>

<p>Alas for "Lift-the-Kettle!". One day,
after returning from a visit to a famous
shrine in the Kuanto, (Eastern Japan), as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
was passing the tea-house, he caught sight
of Kiyohim&eacute;, (the "lady" or "princess"
Kiyo), and from that moment his pain of
heart began. He returned to his bed of
mats, but not to sleep. For days he tried
to stifle his passion, but his heart only
smouldered away like an incense-stick.</p>

<p>Before many days he made a pretext for
again passing the house. Hopelessly in love,
without waiting many days he stopped and
entered the tea-house.</p>

<p>His call for refreshments was answered
by Kiyohim&eacute; herself!</p>

<p>As fire kindles fire, so priest and maiden
were now consumed in one flame of love.
To shorten a long story, "Lift-the-Kettle"
visited the inn oftener and oftener, even
stealing out at night to cross the river and
spend the silent hours with his love.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>So passed several months, when suddenly
a change come over the young bonze. His
conscience began to trouble him for breaking
his vows. In the terrible conflict between
principle and passion, the soul of the
priest was tossed to and fro like the feathered
seed-ball of a shuttlecock.</p>

<p>But conscience was the stronger, and
won.</p>
</div>

<p>He resolved to drown his love and break
off his connection with the girl. To do it
suddenly, would bring grief to her and a
scandal both on her family and the monastery.
He must do it gradually to succeed
at all.</p>

<p>Ah! how quickly does the sensitive love-plant
know the finger-tip touch of cooling
passion! How quickly falls the silver
column in the crystal tube, at the first breath
of the heart's chill even though the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
on the lip are warm! Kiyohim&eacute; marked
the ebbing tide of her lover's regard, and
then a terrible resolve of evil took possession
of her soul. From that time forth, she
ceased to be a pure and innocent and gentle
virgin. Though still in maiden form and
guise, she was at heart a fox, and as to her
nature she might as well have worn the
bushy tail of the sly deceiver. She resolved
to win over her lover, by her importunities,
and failing in this, to destroy him by sorcery.</p>

<p>One night she sat up until two o'clock in
the morning, and then, arrayed only in a
white robe, she went out to a secluded part
of the mountain where in a lonely shrine
stood a hideous scowling image of Fudo,
who holds the sword of vengeance and sits
clothed in fire. There she called upon the
god to change her lover's heart or else destroy
him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>Thence, with her head shaking, and eyes
glittering with anger like the orbs of a
serpent, she hastened to the shrine of Kampira,
whose servants are the long-nosed
sprites, who have the power of magic and
of teaching sorcery. Standing in front of
the portal she saw it hung with votive tablets,
locks of hair, teeth, various tokens
of vows, pledges and marks of sacrifice,
which the devotees of the god had hung up.
There, in the cold night air she asked for
the power of sorcery, that she might be able
at will to transform herself into the terrible
<i>ja</i>,&mdash;the awful dragon-serpent whose engine
coils are able to crack bones, crush rocks,
melt iron or root up trees, and which are
long enough to wind round a mountain.</p>

<p>It would be too long to tell how this once
pure and happy maiden, now turned to an
avenging demon went out nightly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
lonely mountains to practice the arts of
sorcery. The mountain-sprites were her
teachers, and she learned so diligently that
the chief goblin at last told her she would
be able, without fail, to transform herself
when she wished.</p>

<p>The dreadful moment was soon to come.
The visits of the once lover-priest gradually
became fewer and fewer, and were no longer
tender hours of love, but were on his part
formal interviews, while Kiyohim&eacute; became
more importunate than ever. Tears and
pleadings were alike useless, and finally one
night as he was taking leave, the bonze told
the maid that he had paid his last visit.
Kiyohim&eacute; then utterly forgetting all womanly
delicacy, became so urgent that the bonze
tore himself away and fled across the river.
He had seen the terrible gleam in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
maiden's eyes, and now terribly frightened,
hid himself under the great temple bell.</p>

<p>Forthwith Kiyohim&eacute;, seeing the awful
moment had come, pronounced the spell of
incantation taught her by the mountain
spirit, and raised her T-shaped wand. In
a moment her fair head and lovely face,
body, limbs and feet lengthened out, disappeared,
or became demon-like, and a fire-darting,
hissing-tongued serpent, with eyes
like moons trailed over the ground towards
the temple, swam the river, and scenting
out the track of the fugitive, entered the
belfry, cracking the supporting columns
made of whole tree-trunks into a mass of
ruins, while the bell fell to the earth with
the cowering victim inside.</p>

<p>Then began the winding of the terrible
coils round and round the metal, as with her
wand of sorcery in her hands, she mounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>the bell. The glistening scales, hard as
iron, struck off sparks as the pressure increased.
Tighter and tighter they were
drawn, till the heat of the friction consumed
the timbers and made the metal glow hot
like fire.

</p>
</div>

<p>Vain was the prayer of priest, or spell of
rosary, as the bonzes piteously besought
great Buddha to destroy the demon. Hotter
and hotter grew the mass, until the
ponderous metal melted down into a hissing
pool of scintillating molten bronze; and
soon, man within and serpent without, timber
and tiles and ropes were nought but a
few handfuls of white ashes.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>EARLY and lustrous white, like a
cloud in the far-off blue sky,
seemed the floating figure of the
moon-maiden, as she flew to
earth. She was one of the fifteen
glistening virgins that wait attendant upon
the moon in her chambers in the sky. Looking
down from her high home to the earth,
she became enraptured with the glorious
scenery of Suruga's ocean shore, and longed
for a bath in the blue waters of the sea.</p>

<p>So this fairy maid sped to the earth one
morning early, when the moon having shone
through the night was about to retire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the day. The sun was rising bright and red
over the eastern seas, flushing the mountains
and purpling the valleys. Out amid
the sparkling waves the ships sailed toward
the sun, and the fishermen cast their nets.</p>

<p>It was in early spring, when the air was
full of the fragrance of plum blossoms, and
the zephyrs blew so softly that scarce a
bamboo leaf quivered, or a wave lapsed with
sound on the silvery shore.</p>

<p>The moon-maiden was so charmed with
the scenery of earth, that she longed to linger
above it to gaze tranquilly. Floating
slowly through the air, she directed her
course to the pine groves that fringe the
strand near Cape Miwo. Lying at the base
of Fuji mountain, whose snowy crown glistens
above, fronting the ocean, whose blue
plain undulates in liquid glory till it meets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the bending sky, the scenery of Miwo is renowned
everywhere under the whole heavens,
but especially in the land which the
mikado's reign blesses with peace.</p>

<p>Full of happiness, the fairy maiden played
sweet music from her flute, until the air was
full of it, and it sounded to the dweller on
earth like the sweet falling of rain drops on
the thirsty ground. Her body shed sweet
fragrance through the air, and flowers fell
from her robes as she passed. Though none
saw her form, all wondered.</p>

<p>Arriving over a charming spot on the sea
shore, she descended to the strand, and
stood at the foot of a pine tree. She laid
her musical instrument on a rock near by,
and taking off her wings and feathered suit
hung them carefully on the pine tree bough.
Then she strolled off along the shore to dip
her shining feet in the curling waves.</p>

<p>Picking up some shells, she wondered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
innocent joy at the rich tints, which seemed
more beautiful than any color in the moon-world.
With one, a large smooth scallop,
she was particularly pleased; for inside one
valve was a yellow disc, and on its mate
was a white one.</p>

<p>"How strange," said she. "Here is the
sun, and there is the moon. I shall call this
the <i>Tsuki-hi-kai</i>&mdash;'sun and moon shell'," and
she put them in her girdle.</p>

<p>It chanced that near the edge of the pine
grove, not far away, there dwelt a lone fisherman,
who, coming down to the shore,
caught a whiff of sweet perfume such as had
never before delighted his nostrils. What
could it be? The spring zephyrs, blowing
from the west, seemed laden with the sweet
odor.</p>

<p>Curiosity prompted him to seek the cause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
He walked toward the pine tree, and looking
up, caught sight of the feathery suit of
wings. Oh! how his eyes sparkled. He
danced for joy, and taking down the robe
carried it to his neighbors. All were delighted,
and one old man said that the fairy
must herself be near by. He advised the
man to seek until he found her.</p>

<p>So with feathered robe in hand the fisherman
went out again to the strand, and took
his place near the pine tree. He had not
waited long before a lovely being, with rose-tinted
white skin and of perfect form, appeared.</p>

<p>"Please good sir, give me back my feathered
robe," said she, in a sad voice of liquid
sweetness, though she seemed greatly frightened.</p>

<p>"No, I must keep it as a sacred treasure,
a relic from a heavenly visitor, and dedicate
it in the shrine yonder as a memorial of an
angel's visit" said the fisherman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, wicked man, what a wretched and
impious thing to rob an inhabitant of heaven
of the robe by which she moves. How can
I fly back to my home again?"</p>

<p>"Give me your wings, oh ye wild geese
that fly across the face of the moon, and on
tireless pinions seek the icy shores in spring
time, and soar unwearied homeward in
autumn. Lend me your wings."</p>

<p>But the wild geese overhead only whirred
and screamed, and bit their sprays of pine
which they carried in their mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh, ye circling gulls, lend me but for a
day your downy wings. I am prisoner here",
cried the weeping fairy.</p>

<p>But the graceful gulls hovering for a
moment swept on in widening circles out
to farther sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, breezes of the air which blow
whither ye list! Oh, tide of ocean which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
ebbs and flows at will! Ye may move all,
but I am prisoner here, devoid of motion.
Oh, good sir have pity and give me back
my wings," cried the moon-maiden, pressing
her hands together in grief.</p>

<p>The fisher's heart was touched by the
pathos of her voice and the glittering of her
tears.</p>

<p>"I'll give back your winged-robe if you'll
dance and make music for me", said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, good sir, I will dance and make
music, but first let me put on my feather-robe
for without it I have no power of motion."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes", said the suspicious mortal, "If
I give you back your wings you'll fly straight
to heaven."</p>

<p>"What! can you not believe the word of
a heavenly being, without doubting? Trust
me in good faith and you'll lose nothing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<p>Then with shamed face the fisherman
handed to the moon-maiden her feathered
robe, which she donned and began to dance.
She poured out such sweet strains from her
upright flute that with eye and ear full of
rapture, the fisherman imagined himself in
heaven. Then she sang a sweet song in
which she described the delights of life in
the moon and the pleasure of celestial residence.</p>
</div>

<p>The fisherman was so overjoyed that he
longed to detain the fairy. He begged her
to dwell with him on earth, but in vain.
As he looked, he saw her rising. A fresh
breeze, rippling the face of the sea, now
sprang up, and wafted the pearly maiden
over the pine-clad hills and past Fuji mountain.
All the time sweet music rained
through the air until, as the fisherman
strained his eyes toward the fresh-fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
snow on Fuji's crest, he could no longer distinguish
the moon-maiden from the fleecy
clouds that filled the thin air.</p>

<p>Pondering long upon the marvelous apparition,
the fisherman resolved to mark the
spot where the fairy first descended to earth.
So he prevailed upon the simple villagers
to build a railing of stone around the now
sacred pine.</p>

<p>Daily they garlanded the old trunk with festoons
of tasseled and twisted rice-straw.
Long after, when by the storms of centuries
the old pine, in spite of bandages and
crutches, and tired of wrestling with the
blast, fell down like an old man, to rise no
more, a grateful posterity cleared the space
and built the shrine of Miwo, which still
dots with its sacred enclosure the strand of
Suruga on which the fairy danced.

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>HIUAI was the fourteenth mikado
of the Land of the Gods (Japan).
His wife, the empress, was named
Jingu, or Godlike Exploit. She
was a wise and discreet lady and
assisted her husband to govern his dominions.
When a great rebellion broke out in
the south island called Kiushiu, the mikado
marched his army against the rebels. The
empress went with him and lived in the
camp. One night, as she lay asleep in her
tent, she dreamed that a heavenly being appeared
to her and told her of a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
land in the west, full of gold, silver, jewels,
silks and precious stones. The heavenly
messenger told her if she would invade this
country she would succeed, and all its spoil
would be hers, for herself and Japan.</p>

<p>"Conquer Corea!" said the radiant being,
as she floated away on a purple cloud.</p>

<p>In the morning the empress told her husband
of her dream, and advised him to set
out to invade the rich land. But he paid
no attention of her. When she insisted, in
order to satisfy her, he climbed up a high
mountain, and looking far away towards the
setting sun, saw no land thither, not even
mountain peaks. So, believing that there
was no country in that direction he descended,
and angrily refused to set out on the
expedition. Shortly after, in a battle with
the rebels the mikado was shot dead with
an arrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>The generals and captains of the host
then declared their loyalty to the empress
as the sole ruler of Japan. She, now having
the power, resolved to carry out her
daring plan of invading Corea. She invoked
all the <i>kami</i> or gods together, from
the mountains, rivers and plains to get their
advice and help. All came at her call. The
kami of the mountains gave her timber and
iron for her ships; the kami of the fields
presented rice and grain for provisions; the
kami of the grasses gave her hemp for cordage;
and the kami of the winds promised
to open his bag and let out his breezes to
fill her sails toward Corea. All came except
Isora, the kami of the sea shore. Again
she called for him and sat up waiting all
night with torches burning, invoking him
to appear.</p>

<p>Now, Isora was a lazy fellow, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
slovenly and ill-dressed, and when at last he
did come, instead of appearing in state in
splendid robes, he rose right out of the sea-bottom,
covered with mud and slime, with
shells sticking all over him and sea-weed
clinging to his hair. He gruffly asked what
the empress wanted.</p>

<p>"Go down to Riu Gu and beg his
majesty Kai Riu O, the Dragon King of the
World Under the Sea, to give me the two
jewels of the tides," said the imperial lady.</p>

<p>Now among the treasures in the palace of
the Dragon King of the World Under the
Sea were two jewels having wondrous power
over the tides. They were about as large
as apples, but shaped like apricots, with
three rings cut near the top. They seemed
to be of crystal, and glistened and shot out
dazzling rays like fire. Indeed, they appeared
to seethe and glow like the eye of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
dragon, or the white-hot steel of the sword-forger.
One was called the Jewel of the
Flood-Tide, and the other the Jewel of the
Ebb-Tide. Whoever owned them had the
power to make the tides instantly rise or
fall at his word, to make the dry land appear,
or the sea overwhelm it, in the fillip
of a finger.</p>

<p>Isora dived with a dreadful splash, down,
down to Riu Gu, and straightway presented
himself before Kai Riu O. In the name of
the empress, he begged for the two tide-jewels.</p>

<p>The Dragon King agreed, and producing
the flaming globes from his casket, placed
them on a huge shell and handed them to
Isora, who brought the jewels to Jingu, who
placed them in her girdle.</p>

<p>The empress now prepared her fleet for
Corean invasion. Three thousand barges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
were built and launched, and two old kami
with long streaming gray hair and wrinkled
faces, were made admirals. Their names
were Suwa Daimi&#333; Jin (Great Illustrious,
Spirit of Suwa) and Sumiyoshi Daimi&#333; Jin,
the kami who lives under the old pine tree
at Takasago, and presides over nuptial ceremonies.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed in the tenth month. The
hills of Hizen soon began to sink below the
horizon, but no sooner were they out of
sight of land than a great storm arose. The
ships tossed about, and began to butt each
other like bulls, and it seemed as though
the fleet would be driven back; when lo!
Kai Riu O sent shoals of huge sea-monsters
and immense fishes that bore up the ships
and pushed their sterns forward with their
great snouts. The shachihoko, or dragon-fishes,
taking the ship's cables in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
mouths towed them forward, until the storm
ceased and the ocean was calm. Then they
plunged downwards into the sea and disappeared.</p>

<p>The mountains of Corea now rose in sight.
Along the shore were gathered the Corean
army. Their triangular fringed banners,
inscribed with dragons, flapped in the breeze.
As soon as their sentinels caught sight of
the Japanese fleet, the signal was given, and
the Corean line of war galleys moved gaily
out to attack the Japanese.</p>

<p>The empress posted her archers in the
bows of her ships and waited for the enemy
to approach. When they were within a
few hundred sword-lengths, she took from
her girdle the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide
and cast the flashing gem into the sea. It
blazed in the air for a moment, but no sooner
did it touch the water, than instantly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
ocean receded from under the Corean vessels,
and left them stranded on dry land. The
Coreans, thinking it was a tidal wave, and
that the Japanese ships were likewise helpless
in the undertow, leaped out of their
galleys and rushed over the sand, and on to
the attack. With shouting and drawn
swords their aspect was terrible. When
within range of the arrows, the Japanese
bowmen opened volleys of double-headed,
or triple-pronged arrows on the Coreans,
and killed hundreds.</p>
</div>

<p>But on they rushed, until near the Japanese
ships, when the empress taking out the
Flood-Tide Jewel, cast it in the sea. In a
snap of the finger, the ocean rolled up into
a wave many tens of feet high and engulfed
the Corean army, drowning them almost to
a man. Only a few were left out of the ten
thousand. The warriors in their iron armor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
sank dead in the boiling waves, or were cast
along the shore like logs. The Japanese
army landed safely, and easily conquered
the country. The king of Corea surrendered
and gave his bales of silk, jewels, mirrors,
books, pictures, robes, tiger skins, and
treasures of gold and silver to the empress.
The booty was loaded on eighty ships, and
the Japanese army returned in triumph to
their native country.

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OON AFTER her arrival at home,
the empress Jingu gave birth to
a son, whom she named Ojin.
He was one of the fairest children
ever born of an imperial
mother, and was very wise and wonderful
even when an infant. He was a great favorite
of Tak&eacute;nouchi, the prime minister of the
empress. As he grew up, he was full of the
<i>Yamato Damashii</i>, or the spirit of unconquerable
Japan.</p>

<p>This Tak&eacute;nouchi was a very venerable
old man, who was said to be three hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and sixty years old. He had been the counsellor
of five mikados. He was very tall,
and as straight as an arrow, when other old
men were bent like a bow. He served
as a general in war and a civil officer in
peace. For this reason he always kept on a
suit of armor under his long satin and
damask court robes. He wore the bear-skin
shoes and the tiger-skin scabbard which
were the general's badge of rank, and also
the high cap and long fringed strap hanging
from the belt, which marked the court noble.
He had moustaches, and a long beard fell
over his breast like a foaming waterfall, as
white as the snows on the branches of the
pine trees of Ibuki mountain.</p>

<p>Now the empress, as well as Tak&eacute;nouchi,
wished the imperial infant Ojin to live long,
be wise and powerful, become a mighty
warrior, be invulnerable in battle, and to
have control over the tides and the ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
as his mother once had. To do this it was
necessary to get back the Tide Jewels.</p>

<p>So Tak&eacute;nouchi took the infant Ojin on his
shoulders, mounted the imperial war-barge,
whose sails were of gold-embroidered silk,
and bade his rowers put out to sea. Then
standing upright on the deck, he called on
Kai Riu O to come up out of the deep and
give back the Tide Jewels to Ojin.</p>

<p>At first there was no sign on the waves
that Kai Riu O heard. The green sea lay
glassy in the sunlight, and the waves
laughed and curled above the sides of the
boat. Still Tak&eacute;nouchi listened intently
and waited reverently. He was not long in
suspense. Looking down far under the
sparkling waves, he saw the head and fiery
eyes of a dragon mounting upward. Instinctively
he clutched his robe with his
right hand, and held Ojin tightly on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
shoulder, for this time not Isora, but the
terrible Kai Riu O himself was coming.</p>

<p>What a great honor! The sea-king's servant,
Isora, had appeared to a woman, the
empress Jingu, but to her son, the Dragon
King of the World Under the Sea deigned
to come in person.</p>

<p>The waters opened; the waves rolled up,
curled, rolled into wreaths and hooks and
drops of foam, which flecked the dark green
curves with silvery bells. First appeared a
living dragon with fire-darting eyes, long
flickering moustaches, glittering scales of
green all ruffled, with terrible spines erect,
and the joints of the fore-paws curling out
jets of red fire. This living creature was
the helmet of the Sea King. Next appeared
the face of awful majesty and stern mien, as
if with reluctant condescension, and then
the jewel robes of the monarch. Next rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
into view a huge haliotis shell, in which, on
a bed of rare gems from the deep sea floor,
glistened, blazed and flashed the two Jewels
of the Tides.</p>

<p>Then the Dragon-King spoke, saying:</p>

<p>"Quick, take this casket, I deign not to
remain long in this upper world of mortals.
With these I endow the imperial prince of
the Heavenly line of the mikados of the
Divine country. He shall be invulnerable
in battle. He shall have long life. To him
I give power over sea and land. Of this, let
these Tide-Jewels be the token."</p>

<p>Hardly were these words uttered when
the Dragon-King disappeared with a
tremendous splash. Tak&eacute;nouchi standing
erect but breathless amid the crowd of rowers
who, crouching at the boat's bottom had
not dared so much as to lift up their noses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
waited a moment, and then gave the command
to turn the prow to the shore.</p>

<p>Ojin grew up and became a great warrior,
invincible in battle and powerful in peace.
He lived to be one hundred and eleven
years old, and was next to the last of the
long lived mikados of Everlasting Great
Japan.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr15" />

<p>To this day Japanese soldiers honor him
as the patron of war, and pray to him as the
ruler of battle.</p>

<p>When the Buddhist priests came to
Japan they changed his name to Hachiman
Dai Bosatsu, or the "Great Buddha
of the Eight Banners." On many a hill
and in many a village of Japan may
still be seen a shrine to his honor. Often
when a soldier comes back from war, he
will hang up a tablet or picture-frame, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
which is carved a painting or picture of the
two-edged short sword like that which Ojin
carried. Many of the old soldiers who
fought in armor wore a little silver sword of
Ojin set as a frontlet to their helmets, for a
crest of honor. On gilded or lacquered
Japanese cabinets and shrines, and printed
on their curious old, and new greenback
paper money, are seen the blazing Jewels of
the Tides. On their gold and silver coins
the coiled dragon clutches in his claws the
Jewels of the Ebbing and the Flowing
Tide. One of the iron-clad war ships of the
imperial Japanese navy, on which floats
proudly the red sun-banner of the Empire
of the Rising Sun, is named K&#333;g&#333; (Empress)
after the Amazon empress who in the third
century carried the arms of the Island
Empire into the main land of Asia, and won
victory by her mastery over the ebbing and
the flowing tides.

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>F OLD the Heavens and the Earth
were not separated. Land and
water, solids and gases, fire and
stone, light and darkness were
mixed together. All was liquid
and turbid chaos.</p>

<p>Then the mighty mass began to move
from within. The lighter particles of gas
and air began to rise, forming the sky and
heavens. The heavy parts sank and cohered,
becoming the earth. The water formed the
four seas. Then there appeared something
like a white cloud floating between heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and earth. Out of this came forth three
beings&mdash;The Being of the Middle of
Heaven, The High August Being, and The
Majestic Being. These three "hid their
bodies."</p>

<p>Out of the warm mould of the earth something
like a rush sprouted up. It was clear
and bright like crystal. From this rush-sprout
came forth a being whose title is
"The Delightful and Honorable Rush-Sprout."
Next appeared another being out
of the buds of the rush-sprout whose name
is "The Honorable Heaven-born." These
five beings are called "the heavenly gods."</p>

<p>Next came into existence four pairs of
beings viz.: (1) The Being Sprung from the
First Mud, and The Being of the Sand and
Mud; (2) The Being with Hands and Feet
Growing, and the Being Having Breath; (3)
The Male Being, and the Female Being of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the Great Place (the earth); (4) The Being
of Complete Perfection, and the Being who
cried out "Strange and Awful" to her mate.</p>

<p>Thus the last pair that came into existence
were the first man and woman called
Izanagi and Izanami.</p>

<p>It is said that the other pairs of beings
before Izanagi and Izanami were only their
imperfect forms or the processes through
which they passed before arriving at perfection.</p>

<p>These two beings lived in the Heavens.
The world was not yet well formed, and the
soil floated about like a fish in the water,
but near the surface; and was called "The
Floating Region." The sun, earth and moon
were still attached to each other like a head
to the neck, or arms to the body. They
were little by little separating, the parts
joining them growing thinner and thinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
This part, like an isthmus, was called
"Heaven's Floating Bridge." It was on
this bridge that Izanagi and Izanami were
standing when they saw a pair of wagtails
cooing and billing sweetly together. The
heavenly couple were so delighted with the
sight that they began to imitate the birds.
Thus began the art of love, which mortals
have practiced to this day.</p>

<p>While talking together on this Bridge of
Heaven, they began to wonder if there was
a world beneath them. They looked far
down upon the green seas, but could see
nothing! Then Izanagi took his long jeweled
spear and plunged it into the turbid
mass, turning it round and round. As he
lifted it up, the drops which trickled from
it hardened into earth of their own accord;
and thus dry land was formed. As Izanagi
was cleansing his spear the lumps of muck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and mud which had adhered to it flew off
into space, and were changed into stars and
comets.</p>

<p>[It is said that by turning his spear round
and round, Izanagi set the Earth revolving
in daily revolutions].</p>

<p>To the land thus formed, they gave the
name of "The Island of the Congealed
Drop," because they intended to create a
large archipelago and wished to distinguish
this as the first island. They descended
from Heaven on the floating bridge and
landed on the island. Izanagi struck his
tall spear in the ground making it the axis
of the world. He then proceeded to build a
palace around the spear which formed the
central pillar. [This spot was formerly at
the North pole, but is now at Eshima, off
the central eastern coast of Japan]. They
then resolved to walk round the island and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
examine it. This done, they met together.
Izanami cried out, "What a lovely man!"
But Izanagi rebuked her for speaking first,
and said they must try it again. Then they
walked round the island once more. When
they met, Izanami held her tongue while
Izanagi said, "What a lovely woman!"</p>

<p>Being now both in good humor, they began
the work of creating Japan. The first
island brought up out of the water was
Awaji; and then the main island. After
that, eight large islands were created,
whence comes one of the names of Japan,
"The Empire of the Eight Great Islands."
Six smaller islands were also produced. The
several thousand islets which make up the
archipelago of Everlasting Great Japan were
formed by the spontaneous consolidation of
the foam of the sea.</p>
</div>

<p>After the country was thus formed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
divine pair created eight millions of earthly
gods or kami, and the ten thousand different
things on the earth. Vegetation sprang up
over all the land, which was however still
covered with mist. So Izanagi created with
his breath the two gods, male and female of
the wind. All these islands are the children
of Izanagi and Izanami, and when first born
were small and feeble, but gradually grew
larger and larger, attaining their present size
like human beings, which are at first tiny
infants.</p>

<p>As the gradual separation of the land and
sea went on, foreign countries were formed
by the congealing of the foam of the sea.
The god of fire was then born of Izanami,
his mother. This god often got very angry
at any one who used unclean fire. Izanami
then created by herself the gods of metals,
of clay and of fresh water. This latter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
told always to keep the god of fire quiet,
and put him out when he began to do mischief.</p>

<p>Izanagi and Izanami, though married but
a short time, began to quarrel, for Izanami
had once told her husband not to look at
her when she hid herself. But Izanagi did
not do what she requested, but intruded on
her privacy when she was unwell, and stared
at her when she wished to be alone. Izanami
then got very angry, and went down to the
lower world of darkness, and disappeared.</p>

<p>In the dark world under the earth Izanami
stayed a long time, and after long waiting,
Izanagi went after her. In the darkness of
the Under-world he was horrified at what he
saw, and leaving his consort below, tried to
escape to the earth again.</p>

<p>In his struggles several gods were created,
one of them coming out of his staff. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
he got up to daylight, he secured a large rock
to close up the hole in the earth. Turning
this rock into a god, he commanded him to
watch the place. He then rushed into the
sea and continued washing for a long time
to purify himself. In blowing out from his
lungs the polluted air inhaled in the Under-world,
the two evil gods sprang forth from
his breath. As these would commit great
harm and wickedness, Izanagi created two
other gods to correct their evil. But when
he had washed his eyes and could see clearly
again, there sprang out two precious and
lovely beings; one from his left eye, being a
rare and glistening maiden, whom he afterwards
named Ama T&eacute;rasu, or "The Heaven
Illuminating Spirit." From his right eye
appeared Susa no O, the "Ruler of the
Moon." Being now pure again, and having
these lovely children, Izanagi rejoiced and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
said, "I have begotten child upon child, and
at the end of my begetting, I have begotten
me two jewel-children." Now the brightness
of the person of the maiden Ama T&eacute;rasu
was beautiful, and shone through Heaven
and Earth. Izanagi, well pleased, said:
"Though my children are many, none of
them is like this wonder-child. She must
not be kept in this region." So taking off
the necklace of precious stones from his
neck and rattling it, he gave it to her, saying,
"Rule thou over the High Plain of
Heaven."</p>

<p>At that time the distance between Heaven
and Earth was not very great, and he sent
her up to the blue sky by the Heaven-uniting
Pillar, on which the Heavens rested like a
prop. She easily mounted it, and lived in
the sun, illuminating the whole Heavens and
the Earth. The Sun now gradually separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
from the Earth, and both moved farther
and farther apart until they rested
where they now are.</p>

<p>Izanagi next spoke to Susa no O the
Ruler of the Moon, and said, "Rule thou
over the new-born Earth and the blue Waste
of the Sea, with its Multitudinous Salt
Waters."</p>

<p>[So then the Heavens and the Earth and
Moon were created and inhabited. And as
Japan lay directly opposite the sun when
it separated from the Earth, it is plain that
Japan lies on the summit of the globe. It
is easily seen that all other countries were
formed by the spontaneous consolidation of
the ocean foam, and the collection of mud
in the various seas. The stars were made
to guide warriors from foreign countries to
the court of the Mikado, who is the true Son
of Heaven].

        <div style="width: 70px;" ></div>
    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN THE far-shining goddess,
on account of the evil pranks
of her brother, Susa no O, the
Ruler of the Moon, hid herself
in a cave, there was no more
light, and heaven and earth were plunged
into darkness.</p>

<p>A council of all the gods was held in the
dry bed of one of the rivers [which we call
the Milky Way] in the fields of Heaven.
The question of how to appease the anger
of the goddess was discussed. A long-headed
and very wise god was ordered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
think out a plan to entice her forth from
the cave.</p>

<p>After due deliberation, it was resolved
that a looking-glass should be made to tempt
her to gaze at herself, and that tricks should
be played to arouse her curiosity to come
out and see what was going on.</p>

<p>So setting to work with a will, the gods
forged and polished a mirror, wove cloth for
beautiful garments, built a pavilion, carved
a necklace of jewels, made wands, and tried
an augury.</p>

<p>All being ready, the fat and rosy-cheeked
goddess of mirth with face full of dimples,
and eyes full of fun, named Uzum&eacute;, was
selected to lead the dance. She had a flute
made from a bamboo cane by piercing holes
between the joints, while every god in the
great orchestra had a pair of flat hard wood
clappers, which he struck together.</p>

<p>She bound up her long flowing sleeves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
with a creeper vine, and made for herself
a baton of twigs of bamboo grass, by which
she could direct the motions of the musicians.
This she held in one hand while in
the other was a spear wound round with
grass, on which small bells tinkled. Great
bonfires were lighted in front of the cave,
so that the audience of gods could see the
dance. A large circular box which resounded
like a drum when trod on, was set up for
Uzum&eacute; to dance upon. The row of cocks
now began to crow in concert.</p>

<p>All being ready, the Strong-handed god
who was to pull the sun-goddess out of the
cave, as soon as overcome by her curiosity
she should peep forth, hid himself beside
the stone door of the cave. Uzum&eacute; mounted
the box and began to dance. As the drum-box
resounded, the spirit of folly seized her,
and she began to chant a song.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<p>Becoming still more foolish, Uzum&eacute;
waved her wand wildly, loosened her dress,
and danced till she had not a stitch of clothing
left on her. The gods were so amused
at her foolishness that they all laughed, until
the heavens shook as with claps of thunder.</p>

<p>The Sun-goddess within the cave heard
all these strange noises; the crowing of the
cocks, the hammering on the anvil, the chopping
of wood, the music of the koto, the
clappering of the hard wood, the tinkling of
the bells, the shouting of Uzum&eacute; and the
boisterous laughter of the gods. Wondering
what it all meant, she peeped out.</p>

<p>As she did so the Doubly Beautiful
goddess held up the mirror.</p>

<p>The Far-Shining one seeing her own face
in it was greatly astonished. Curiosity got
the better of fear. She looked far out.
Instantly the strong-handed god pulled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
rocky door open, and seizing her hand,
dragged her forth. Then all the heavens
and earth were lightened, the trees and
grass became green again, and the goddess
of colors resumed her work of tinting the
flowers. The gloom fled from all eyes, and
human beings again became "white-faced."</p>

<p>Thus the calamity which had befallen
heaven and earth, by the sun-goddess hiding
in the cave became a means of much benefit
to mortals. For by their necessity the gods
were compelled to invent the arts of metal-working,
weaving, carpentry, jeweling and
many other useful appliances for the human
race. They also on this occasion first made
use of music, dancing, the Dai Kagura (The
comedy which makes the gods laugh) and
many of the games which the children play
at the present time.</p>
